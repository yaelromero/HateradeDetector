1	"`NEWLINE_TOKEN::Thanks. I'll expand on what Tiptoety says. The first unblock request was declined by himself on the grounds that Miyokan was a confirmed sockpuppet of myself...and we all know where that lead. The other unblock requests were due to what we now know was a major f' up, and one which is yet to be addressed to my satisfaction. What you are seeing on the admin noticeboard is nothing more than an attempt to get rid of an adversary, and this is evident by the continual support of the editor who is responsible for that foul mouthed tirade which I posted earlier...look at Biophys' own comments from 03:50, 17 September 2008. The other thing that hasn't been addressed is why was this supposed outting done by an editor? What was the reason behind it? I know what was behind it, but does anyone else? Does anyone care? I'll tell you, it was an attempt to make people understand why certain editors hold such fringe views and they are prominently making their way into articles...such as the belief that Putin is a paedophile...a belief that was re-affirmed after  commented to Biophys that ``outlandish remarks...in public fora are completely outrageous``. Taken into account what I perceive as WP:OWN (on articles such as Talk:Web_brigades), taken into account other editors with their unhelpful interjections such as on Talk:Georgia_for_Georgians (an article which you may be interested in helping to develop...contact me for sources if you like, ranging from Russian, Georgian, Western, HRW, UNHCR, and other international organisations). On that article, look here , why are they running to Moreschi for this? Of course I wouldn't put it past certain editors to try to AfD it in my absence, so please keep an eye on that. What you are seeing on that noticeboard is nothing more than a rabid pack of dogs trying to take down an adversary - and I stand by that rapid pack of dogs comments, you need only see from when I was a confirmed sockpuppeteer. And I am still questioning why Moreschi, who is an involved admin (as one can clearly see) is handing out 2 week blocks to editors for nothing more than a friendly notice of a COI. Unfortunately, you won't be able to view that as it has been removed from all records; it was not accusatory in nature, it was a mere alerting an editor to the fact that because they are involved that they may have a possible COI; done as the article itself stated the project is the only one of its kind, yet I couldn't find a cited source that states that. Of course WP:AGF is non-existent with this pack obviously, and WP:CIVIL is out of the question also; and that has been raised as to why Moreschi is able to get away with calling an editor the ``very worst of the Russian nationalist crowd not currently banned`` and an editor who is prone to ``egregious nuttery``; he is not an innocent bystander, he is deeply involved in this, and it is inappropriate for an involved admin to be handing out blocks.    `"

It was originally used to combat the commercialized glam and pop metal styles of the time. It came into wider use in the 1990s as newer subgenres such as nu-metal and alternative metal came into existence. It is used to differentiate between these non-traditional styles and long-established and integritous forms of Heavy Metal, such as thrash metal, power metal, death metal, black metal, doom metal, and the NWOBHM among others.`` Jay316 `"

0	"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnswer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus."

Django's templates, for example, embody the pure presentational logic which is called the ``view`` in strict MVC, and a Django ``view`` actually does most of the duties of a strict-MVC controller (database interaction and selecting a template to use for presentation). These differences arise because, historically speaking, Django is more concerned with ease of use and practicality than with design-pattern purity.  `"

And independent evidence from growing Antarctic ice, that this year global sea ice is back to normal and even Greenland surface ice is growing strongly suggests that there is no current warming and that the surface data is corrupted either by these warming adjustments or by urban heating.

If Wikipedia is about accuracy, then I am confused as to why I would be banned from editing a un-factual article...particularly when I make sure to source my additions or changes. Everyone does this on Wikipedia, if I am going to be blocked for this...Jdorney should to, sine he does the same thing...or do editors get special treatment.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnother ridiculous complaint was made by SWATJester about the SAD article.

I have the right to edit just like everyone else, as long as I source my edits (which I always do). If people disagree with my edits, they can tell me in a grown-up professional way, or they can re-edit the article. I am more then willing to work with people on Wikipedia, but to be blocked for bogus reasons is a disgrace. I have obeyed the rules of Wikipedia, if I am doing something wrong, send me a message, and I will adress that. But I will not stop contributing to articles, that is the whole point of Wikipedia, if it bothers some editors like SWATJeaster and Jdorney...well, that's too bad, they need to get over themselves, and either fact check their articles, or make it so nobody can change them. It amazes me that these two are so petty that they block someone for doing the same things they do...pathetic."

The water is circulating and can actually swallow or release the heat from up to hundreds of meters of the upper ocean pretty quickly; on the other hand, it takes years for the heat to get dozens of meters of the soil.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:That's also why the continental ice sheets are much more variable - and much more important for the global variability of the climate - than effects that occur on the sea.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Emile Durkheim ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy have you removed the edit to the suicide section in Emile Durkheim's page which mentioned that egoistic suicide is also known as egotistical suicide?  This is a productive edit, as many editions/translations refer to only one term and not the other.  Readers should be aware of the relation between the terms.  ??÷Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKEN:It's redundant. Egotistic- and egotistical-suicide are the same thing.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::That is the point to stating that it is ``also known as`` the other term.  The words are not the same: egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking.  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms.  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheim's theory is significant.  This information - a matter of 5 words - should be included in Wikipedia's article.  Both are valid terms with different implications.  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing.NEWLINE_TOKENAccording Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary they're the same words. 'He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons', same thing.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Unless that was a typo, you just used exactly the same word twice.  The difference is between EGOISTIC (one 'T') and EGOTISTICAL (two 'T's).  Look up the two words in Merriam-Webster.  ??÷Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENSorry, that was a typo. Forget the examples, the word has the same meaning (even according to our very own encyclopedia) and so differntiation is not necessary.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I support RaseaC's decision. Saying that ``egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking`` is a very, very vague differentiation: even by your definitions I don't see what the difference is. Even we just supposed that the two terms referred to two different things, it would almost logically imply the terms ``egoistical suicide`` and ``egotistical suicide`` have different meanings.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::For my part, however, I am quite certain that Durkheim did not intend to use two distinct words with different meanings to refer to the same thing. If the two words have been equally used by translators, I believe we can fairly assume that they refer to the same thing. Thus, no need to distinguish between the two words: they mean, and refer to, the exact same thing.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:They may, indeed, refer to the same thing - after all, that is why both are used.  People do interpret what they read based on the literal meanings of words, however, so it should be noted that translations of this book use the terms interchangeably, regardless of etymology.  Further, the main point is this: look at other Wikipedia articles.  Take the ``Simpson's paradox`` as an example.  The article mentions that this concept has gone by at least four different names, each of which is listed.  Those are all names for exactly the same thing.  REAL ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLES MENTION ALL SYNONYMOUS AND RELATED TERMS.  Your discrimination, in this case, is an unnecessary inhibition to Wikipedia's potential.  The addition of five extra words, which acknowledge that this phenomenon has another name, is not detrimental to the Wikipedia article.  On the contrary, it is a simple relation of facts - the very purpose of an encyclopedia to begin with.  ??÷Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKEN::Not only do they refer to the same thing, the words are synonyms which is why it is redundant to list both. The Simpson's Paradox example is irrelevant because those are four completely different terms, which use completely different words. If it makes it easier, think of 'egoistic' and 'egotistical' being the same words (as that is, effectively, what they are). It is detrimental to the article as so far as it is redundant wording, which should be avoided so as to improve the readibility of the sentence.

1	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*What I appreciate about this discussion, is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved - both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue. I believe this is appropriate (though admittedly tiring) because, in legal matters, a great deal often hinges on a comma, or the inclusion/exclusion of the word ``not,`` or other such maddening technicalities. Ergo Shakespeare's famous dictum about lawyers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v. Rullan does provide federal precedent, and a framework for discussion and debate. However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U.S. constitutional question or territorial status issue, since the U.S. Supreme Court is the court of ultimate (and binding) jurisdiction in both of these areas.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself (as opposed to those living on the mainland). The Rullan court stated that ``Congress today, thus, must afford Puerto Rico and the 4,000,000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:However, as stated earlier, Puerto Rico is subject to the U.S. Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article?ßIV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.U.S. Const. art. IV, ?? 3, cl. 2 (``The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States?ß...``). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008. Three years later (in 2011), insular Puerto Ricans have neither U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators, and they cannot vote for a U.S. president. Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully-enfranchised U.S. citizens, and they have not been extended ``enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It is thus clear that (in the exercise of its plenary powers) the U.S. Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN:The operative word in this discussion (and I understand the frustration on both sides) is the usage of the word ``must`` in the Rullan ruling. As forceful as that word sounds, it was mis-used by the Rullan court, because the U.S. Congress clearly ignored it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Again...a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan. The U.S. Congress ignored it. Puerto Ricans (on the island) are not fully-enfranchised, and therefore do not have ``enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I hope this helps your process of consensus.

1	"`:JohnZ: The post war protests in Israel that you refer to were not a product of the results on the battlefield. They were a product of an Israeli constituency that demands perfection from its leaders. Israelis were more than satisfied by the achievements of their army. They were angry over their government???s failure to read the writings on the wall. But this had nothing whatsoever to do with the favorable results achieved by the IDF on the battlefield. And to be sure, there was also fallout in Egypt where Shazli was dismissed from the army and later placed under house arrest. The commanders of the 2nd and 3rd armies were also dismissed from the army. In Syria, a general was executed even before the war ended. Just imagine however, if Syria and Egypt were open democracies where freedom of expression was permitted. Could you imagine protests in Syria over how its soldiers were defeated despite the element of surprise and numerically superior forces? Can you imagine Egyptian protests over how the Second and Third armies failed to recognize the gap between their forces? Or why they didn???t recognize the Israeli incursion for what it was? Or why Sadat didn???t heed Shazli???s request to pull forces back to the west bank to meet the Israeli encirclement action? Or how on October 14, Ismail allowed his tank forces to emerge from the SAM umbrella only to be massacred? or why the Egyptian and Syrian airforces performed so miserably against the IAF in air-to-air combat? I can go on and on. My point is that discourse, protests and demonstrations in these dictatorships would be met with an iron fist, arrest, killings, torture etc... Does Hama come to mind? The only line fed to these people was government propaganda which the people of Egypt and Syria swallowed if they knew it was good for them. Egypt claimed victory in 1956 as well. Does that make it so? Egyptian propagandists were claiming that they were well on their way to Tel-Aviv in the Six Day War. Does that make it so? Claims of Arab ``victory`` have become threadbare, even in the Arab world. Incidentally, I have yet to see one commission of inquiry formed by any arab government to investigate a government shortcoming.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`"

As the manga progresses further and further, it also diverges further and further from the ending fabricated by the creators of the anime series. The nature of the philosopher's stone, the homunculi, their creator, Hoenheim, the gate, and even the world itself is very different. It may in fact be prudent to split this article (which is getting rather long anyway) into two separate articles, Fullmetal Alchemist (Manga) and Fullmetal Alchemist (Anime), with a short disambiguation page taking the place of the main page. Since many of the pages linked to on the main page are specific to manga and anime anyway, this would simply allow us to present a cleaner overall summary. Any thoughts?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I'd prefer keeping things together as much as possible, giving precedence to the manga and simply explaining the differences in the anime series in the subsidiary articles. This, especially since the manga length is now dwarfing that of the anime, will be the best option in the long run. Atomizing the pages simply because of some differences won't help much, we'd hardly benefit by having a seperate Pride (Fullmetal alchemist manga) and Pride (Fullmetal alchemist anime).    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::That is an insanely ridiculous idea. Your point on the different lengths and content of the two forms of FMA merely underscore the necessity of separating the article. The majority of people who have experienced FMA and link to it at Wikipedia for the first time have no idea that an FMA manga even exists, apart from the general knowledge that most successful animes have a manga form. The majority of people who would consider themselves fans of FMA have never read a single FMA manga. This also underscores the vast difference between the two subjects. For they are just that. Two entirely different subjects.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I can see that there might be a need to consolidate minor linked pages. I am all for this. But trying to write a combined article for both the manag and anime is impossible. And by this I mean that the current article utterly fails the public. It needs to be separated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Most important of all perhaps, is that the subjects need be treated VERY differently. All information about FMA (anime) is currently either known or obtainable. The community needs to focus on improving this article to reflect that knowledge.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::All of the information regarding FMA (manga) is not known. Because it does not exist yet. The manga is not finished. The community needs to focus on ordering information efficiently to account for the addition of future information, and reflecting what is currently not known concerning the series.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::In fact there are numerous reasons why the two articles subjects should be given separate article. But as they are all obvious I will not needlessly list them.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It seems like no one has commented on this again in a while, but the fact of the matter is that while over the years, the manga has become increasingly discrete from the anime, it has lately become so separate that this article merely adds to the confusion. This is hardly something that could be appreciated w/n an encyclopedia, and requires serious revision. I plan to attempt this, but I would probably drown in my procrastination w/o help. The general opinion of others I've talked to seems to be that every time people try to correct something, it is edited out again, presumably by fans of the anime. Then again, 'gneral opinion' was stated by one person on a forum I visit, and I've yet to figure out whether others consent to this b/c they agree or b/c they don't want to argue w/ that person. Frankly, I admire and fear this person about as much as you can someone you've only met in cyberspace, but other opinions and support would be helpful. Very.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Please.

As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics??Ñ.   In other words ??????????1, there are ?? proponents of Ebonics??? and are ?? anti-proponents of Ebonics???.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ?? proponents of Ebonics???.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  ??úthe OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) ``Ebonics``, (2) ``Pan African Communication Behaviors`` and/or (3) ``African Language Systems``.  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.

I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics ??úis the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English`` (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE??Ñ is Eurocentric??Ñ.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics ??úis the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English`` (and thus a rejection of the notion of ``African American Vernacular English`` but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)`` is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.

0	" That is because what you are finding is from the old classification system, which is still widely distributed on the net. The newer system (which identifies 5 subspecies within the United States as opposed to 20 odd) lumps many groups (including the original Great Plains wolf population which was thought to have become extinct) into a single Canis lupus nubilis otherwise called the Plains wolf, Great plains wolf, or Buffalo wolf. This, like is illustrated on the map, ranges throughout Eastern Canada and North East USA. The reason many sources will say it is the Eastern timber wolf I believe is mainly to help conservation. Not only does the name seem more attractive to residents (therefore they are more likely to want to preserve it) but this wolf is comparitively vulnerable in it's smaller range. Another confusion may be because Eastern timber wolves used to live in this area, but were killed off due to the bounties. It was then the other subspecies, the Plains wolf, which eventually reinhabited the North Eastern states. When I have more time I will try to finda reliable source forthis.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN"

0	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:*Just because you feel this page is stupid doesn't give you the authority or reason to decide if this article should be published or not. Mexicans, as a people, are a very complex subject and we have been doing our best to create an encyclopedic and scholarly article about them. There also isn't any reason not to create those articles on Peruvians, Argentinians etc.. if they are done properly. If you want to create such articles then go ahead, just make sure to cite your sources and follow wikipedia's guidelines. Now as to your objection of Mexicans being an ethnic group it seems you do not comprehend what that term means. Many people very often confuse the term ethnicity with race. The following is the same response I gave user  on his talk page when he asked me about this same subject: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbout ethnicity and race these terms are not the same thing. Race would constitute the biological composition of individuals or groups, in which case Mexicans are mostly bi-racial (Amerindian/European). The racial/biological composition of Mexicans is not very important because the article deals with Mexicans as an ethnic group which, according to Fredrik Barth: ``can be said to exist when people claim a certain identity for themselves and are defined by others as having that identity.`` (Ethnic Groups and Boundaries: The Social Organization of Cultural Difference. London: Allen & Unwin. 1969.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo quote Conrad Phillip Kottak in the text book: Window on Humanity a concise introduction to Anthropology Pages 217-218: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs with any culture, members of an ethnic group share certain beliefs, values, habits, customs, and norms, because of their common background. They define themselves as different and special because of cultural features. This distinction may arise from language, religion, historical experience, geographic isolation, kinship, or ``race.`` Markers of an ethnic group may include a collective name, belief in common descent, a sense of solidarity, and an association with a specific territory which the group may or may not hold... Ethnicity means identification, and feeling part of, an ethnic group and exclusion from certain other groups because of this affiliation. Ethnic feelings and associated behavior vary in intensity within ethnic groups and countries and over time.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wanted to create an article on Mexicans as ``one people`` where the point of view comes from anthropology, culture, biology, history and is as far away from ethnic nationalism and political correctness as possible. I'm Mexican myself and I can safely say that we all see ourselves basically as one race (despite the fact we are mestizos) or at the very least as one people. For the most part we are blind to racial differences within out own group but there exist many who suffer some sort of identity crisis and lean toward one group or the other and begin racist agendas within the collective identity of Mexicans as a group. To put it in short words, I wanted to create a scientifically objective article on the Mexican People without the mainstream distortions and prejudices and without any inclination to any ethnic/political/national agenda like so many that are floating around all over the internet. It's nice to see other people are getting interested in the project but I believe balance will be the greatest chore here since everyone wants to tell their side of the story.

These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the ``first do no harm`` idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I understand it may feel as if you're being reverted by a faceless mass, but I assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive.

The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous. Her very own source backed me! That TG/TS women are for the CDC's and any other medical purpose biologically male, that the MSM category does not take into account any aspec of identity. Which would include gender identity. Case closed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The rest of this has just been about Puella and her personal feelings.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo, my source states that gender identity is not tracked at all, so the assumption on their part is that everyone is reported as they ``biological`` sex.  However, again, if a TS/TG were reported as female, since no gender identity information would be collected there would be no indication of which were which.  Literally TS/TG information is entirely intermingled, in some indeterminable amount.  The ambiguity of not collecting TS/TG information means that there is simply a blanket assumption about how the information is received from the CDC... the true answer is, because of the ambiguity no one knows how they're split up... the data is intermingled, and there is no way to separate the information.  Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked ``are you pregnant?`` when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.  Without collecting gender identity information, no one can with certainty that all TS/TG are recorded as MSM.  The answer is ``it's inconsistent and no one knows``, not ``haha I'm right, you're wrong, TS/TG are always MSM``.   `"

You've requested clarification, so here goes:NEWLINE_TOKEN:*The image by Paolo Varonese that you call ``a true icon`` is completely dominated by religious imagery while the depiction of the actual battle is cluttered, unaesthetic and very dark. To make anything out, it has to be set to a very large size. This takes up way too much room for a simple infobox. There are simply much better images for this purpose, and none of them can be said to be ``truer`` than the others.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*You're insisting on using coats of arms rather than flags. They are almost impossible to make out at such a low resolution. Despite this, they still take up much more room than simple flags. The point of the flags is to give a visual queue, not to depict the most accurate contemporary standards or symbols of any region or individual.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Breaking down the number of soldiers into ``divisions`` is not relevant in an infobox. They're supposed to give a quick overview of the numbers to get a sense of scale and proportions.

Of course there may be interesting things there. Same with other methods, etc. But this whole topic (guitar pedagogy) seems to be one, where I can get information from anyone, even my neighbor. In other words: The body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is, to a great extent, not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. Hence I detest when Risteski writes ``this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musical-aesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music``. What he wishes to display as something ``new``, is rather something that I could easily learn and find, while having discussions with my friends, with a glass of wine. So 'cheers' to guitar philosophy!  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the same time, I can look at the article and see it empty. Risteski's articles can at least provide some food for thought; and that would be a reason to include them in the external links.

In regard to the, I believe, Kurd supplied image showing a Muslim child kicking at a pixelated area of ground, against reliable sources, I advise caution.  Islam has strict rules on health issues on topics such as Halal and I don't think there should be ready acceptance of the idea of a severed head being left on a pavement with a smiling man holding a bare footed child in the air so as to help the child kick a dead, severed head.  It would have been very easy for, I believe, the Kurdish (Islamic) source to have found a photo and doctored.  ISIL killings that I have seen can involve victims kneeling in front of a grave so that they can fall in when shot and some of the activities seem to be relatively clinical.  This is not to say that stories involving the use of heads aren't true but unless evidence becomes really clear I would caution against using Wikipedia's voice to state facts.

It first talk about Max Scheubner, it also quote from him. Then talk about the ten commandments of the Ittihadists and the Turkish government plan of destruction of the entire Armenian community. Then, the only thing which is the closest to what Ottomanreference attribute to that page is this following passage: Through the use of centralized planning and modern communication systems, all Armenians were to be assaulted. For the Turks, the sole question was: When? They did not have long to wait. In spring of 1915, Russian troops invaded Turkish territory following a failed Turkish offensive in the Caucasus. Sensing the opportunity, nationalist Armenians established a provisional government in the Russian-occupied era. Here was the proof of the ``internal enemy`` the Turks had long claimed them to be, and Enver Pasha, the Turkish minister of war, did not hesitate to... Then the rest of the page relate to the destruction of the Armenians. This is also another example of a footnote not supporting the text it is supposed to source.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe book is at the state library; I have a very short note. It says; ``page 38, the setting of the provisional government``.

While I dont't think it's perfect (I have a few issues with it that I'll be raising on here) I think it's a gross mischaracterisation to say that it's a puff piece for PETA (gotta love aliteration). Stating what PETA's philosophy is without critiquing it is not POV, provided the statement is credited and not advocated it's the very epitome of NPOV. Note that the exact same format being used for The Foundation for Animal Use and Education's philosophy, which is critical of the notion of animal rights. As to the specific issue of the Catholic Church's attitude to animal rights, as others have stated to mention just the Catholic Church in isolation is to give undue prominence; to mention only one religion is to give the impression that only one religion has an attitude to the subject that is worth mentioning. An ``Animal rights and religion`` section would have merit in it, and would probably bring an interesting perspective to the issue, my one piece of caution on the issue would be that the issue should be limited to the specifics of animal rights, rather than animal welfare.   16:21, 7`"

He taught them the cultivation of the earth, gave them a body of laws, and instructed them in the worship of the gods.

During his absence, the land of Egypt was so well ruled by his wife Isis, that his jealous brother Typhon (Set), the personification of evil, as Osiris was the personification of good, could do no harm in his kingdom; but on the return of Osiris to Egypt, Typhon made a conspiracy against him, persuading 72 other persons to join him, together with a certain Queen of Ethiopia named Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at the time (74 altogether)...

At the first read, I immediatly got the impression that the article was written by a fan, and that the text didn't flow as well as it could because too much detail and too many quotes of more or less relavancy were included in the narative.  You seem to resist the editing of the article by others, reverting the article atleast 6 times in the last two hours.  This is not constructive.  If others choose to edit an article, it is because they want to make the article better, either by adding more detail, or by making the existing detail easier to find or understand.  We're all here to build a better encyclopedia, and sometimes a better encyclopedia is built by tightening up content so that it is presented in a clearer, more consise manner.

So I just don't understand what you mean by ``block-evading sockpuppeteer`` and when Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template way before I had made any edits to the template, and all I persume is that the reason why Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template in the first place was that he is a key member of Roc Nation due to him being co-owner of Roc Nation UK-based subsidiary Takeover Roc Nation record label and entertainment company, the same goes to Stargate (production team) who are the co-owners of the Roc Nation US-based StarRoc record label and publishing company.

It is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name. A few points. Moving from Toronto to B.C was for one sole reason and that was to find work. There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001. I still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion, and that is my right.NEWLINE_TOKENIt has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Apparently she wants no one to know that Ryulong deleted my request for help on Khoikhoi's talk page, falsely describing my request for help as ``vandalism`` in his edit summary.

Come to think of it, every time an admin describes a user's action as ``vandalism``, or a user as a ``vandal``, that's an improper ``personal attack``, according to pschemp's logic. If pschemp treats people equally (not likely), then she better block all the admins who make those ``personal attacks`` of describing a particular user's behavior as ``vandalism``.

With all respect to the book's authors, it is not a reliable source in nuclear issues.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::2. Buying hundreds of Po-containing devices cannot be a big problem for a potential nuclear terrorist in any case. In other article by Acton, Rogers, and Zimmerman, they write: ``A Briton, Dhiren Barot, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2006 for planning to build a dirty bomb out of some 10,000 smoke detectors, each of which contains a small radioactive source, for use in London.`` 10,000 is two orders of magnitude more then hundreds. NEWLINE_TOKEN:::3. Actually, no need to buy small devices. Zimmerman says about 16 Ci of Po-210 (that's 200 times more than 3 GBq) one may get without a strict state control. There are air ionizers with sources of as much as 7.4 GBq on the market (2.5 times the dose Litvinenko was killed by). They can be bought by anybody under ``modest restraints`` (see http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1717/nureg-1717.pdf , page 4-5; there are estimations on the page 4-7 that ~10000 of 7.4GBq air ionizers are produced and distributed annually in the US market). NEWLINE_TOKEN:::4. The quoted articles by Zimmerman et al. clearly say about danger of illicit use of Po-containing devices by a group of nuclear terrorists. Just due to this Zimmerman propose to restrict the availability of such devices. NEWLINE_TOKEN:::5.Other theories suggest that the polonium that killed Litvinenko might have been obtained from an officially tracked commercial supply after it reached its final customer. Polonium is commonly used in static eliminators in printing plants, photography labs and textile mills. In these applications, it is bound in extremely small quantities with other metals. Extracting the substance from the molds in which these mixtures are made would be difficult because ``polonium science is quite complicated,`` Priest said. But with qualified scientists and the right lab conditions, it is possible. ``I can see how they could be used to brew up a dose to kill one person,`` said Peter D. Zimmerman, a nuclear physicist and professor of science and security at King's College London. ``It would require very delicate lab work.``() NEWLINE_TOKEN:::6. So, I provided you the recent secondary sources by experts which claim that the amount of polonium Litvinenko was poisoned by could be received from non-state-controlled supply. These opinions should be reflected in the article.   `"
0	", which really stings while"
0	"NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I am always skeptical about these 'naked spacewalks' for various reasons. They say our body is ~70% water, but that does not really paint an accurate picture. The reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at STP. The key here is the STP part. As with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. Similarly, if your body went rapidly from STP to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. To be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. About the closest I've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film Event Horizon, where it shows all the vessels on Justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. But still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. It seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure.   "

He added the Logan Darrow to his name a few years ago.  After graduating from University of Rochester's MBA program in the late 80s, he went to the Pacific Northwest and tried a corporate job for about 6 months before departing.  He started a magazine, American Venture Capital Exchange, that had a modest amount of success matching entrepreneurs with investors.  He sold the magazine a few years ago and since then he has been trying to get his TV show, The Lexington League, off the ground.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn my opinion, The Lexington League is basically a free-market, pro-liberty version of 60 Minutes.

However, he has avoided any public acknowledgement that the idea was anyone's except his own and he has declined to take advantage of my contacts including the aforementioned attorney as well as a friend of a friend who is a real estate developer.  This leads me to believe that he is not serious about the use of eminent domain against Souter and he is really interested in getting people to mail him money and increasing the public's awareness of his TV show.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is my conclusion.

1	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Well, putting this section in the article was not a consensual decision to begin with. This unsourced section was unilaterally created barely a month ago (without even an edit summary) by , a newly registered user who had created his Wikipedia account only four days earlier. I agree with Diaa's decision to remove this section, for the following reasons:NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*Having a ``Persecution of Copts`` level-2 heading in a general article about Egypt is a clear violation of WP:STRUCTURE and WP:UNDUE. We already have a Persecution of Copts article where such issues are discussed at length, and there is a hatnote linking to this article in the ``Christianity`` sub-section. The discrimination faced by Copts is also discussed in the ``Human rights`` section. Having such information discussed three times in the article gives it undue weight.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*Such a section is a total departure from the standard sub-division of country-related articles. It is generally agreed upon at Wikipedia that country articles should only have sections covering top-importance topics, such as ``History``, ``Geography``, ``Economy``... Without belittling the difficulties faced by some Copts in Egypt, the ``persecution of copts`` is not a major topic to be discussed so prominently (by prominently, I mean by having a section devoted solely to it) in a general-interest article about Egypt. There are other countries where minorities fare far worse than in Egypt, yet we don't have specific sections in those countries' articles dealing with such issues. For instance, there's no ``Persecution of Arab-Israelis`` section in the Israel article, no ``Persecution of Tibetans`` in the People's Republic of China article, no ``Persecution of Shi'a Muslims`` in the Saudi Arabia article, no ``Persecution of Roma`` in the Hungary article, no ``Persecution of Kurds`` in the Turkey article... In fact, the persecution of minorities is not mentioned at all in any of these articles (some of which are/were FAs), let alone in a separate section. Therefore, compared to other articles, the Egypt article's dicussion of the discrimination faced by Copts is already quite sufficient and does not justify a separate section.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*The section is a clear violation of WP:UNSOURCED, which explicitly says that ``any material lacking a reliable source directly supporting it may be removed.`` The section makes extremely grave and serious accusations, such as claims of ethnic cleansing and accusations of complicity on the part of government officials in the persecution of Copts, without citing any source whatsoever, let alone a reliable one. By removing this section, Diaa didn't do anything wrong, since WP:UNSOURCED explicitly says: ``Do not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living persons or organizations.``NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*I disagree with Lanternix's assertion that ``there is nothing controversial about the section.`` In its current form, the section is clearly biased and in violation of WP:NPOV. Here are some examples:NEWLINE_TOKEN::::*The word ``persecution`` itself is highly charged. The Arab-West Report, which the section cites, speaks not of persecution but of discrimination, which is a more appropriate concept to describe the Copts' situation. The U.S. Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report (a highly reputable and non-partisan source) enumerates several examples of discrimination faced by Copts, yet it uses the verb ``persecuted`` only once, in reference to converts from Islam to Christianity. This is due to the fact that persecution requires some degree of systematic state-sanctioned violence, and only converts are systematically targeted and surveilled by the Egyptian police. While Copts undeniably face discrimination in Egypt, whether or not they ``suffer organized persecution`` as claimed in the section is a matter of serious contention. The issue of conversion, which is cited as an example of Coptic discrimination, is actually an example of discrimination against Muslims, since it is Muslim citizens' right to change their religion that is being infringed upon. Coptic-born citizens are unaffected by the controversy surrounding conversions.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::*Some of the issues described in the section are presented as straight facts, when the reality is in fact far more nuanced. For instance, the section plainly states that ``Coptic girls are victims of abduction and forced Islamization by Islamic fundamentalist groups``. However, this is what the International Religious Freedom Report has to say about the issue: ``As in previous years, there were occasional claims of Muslim men forcing Coptic wo"

I am in the faculty of business and economics.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Have you ever had any sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Yes, I had.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: How often do you have sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Not very often. I have plenty of choices for drinks.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: On what occasions do you have sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Well??¬ There???re no particular occasions that I would have sports drinks. I???ll have them whenever they come to my mind??¬like, when I???m studying or merely when I???m thirsty.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Why do you think you would have sports drinks on those occasions, say when you are studying or when you are thirsty?NEWLINE_TOKENR: I have sports drinks when I???m studying, because I believe that they could help to keep my spirits, so that I could concentrate on my studies. You know, your mind doesn???t function after reading the boring textbooks for a period of time. Having some sports drinks could get you freshen up.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Please tell me the brands of sports drinks that you know. Name as many as possible.NEWLINE_TOKENR: Pocari, Gatorade??¬ I don???t know??¬ Is Redbull a kind of sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENG: No, it isn???t. Sports drinks are beverages that are intended to replenish nutrients, water, sugars and so on. Redbull is classified as an energy drink, as it is rich in sugars and caffeine.NEWLINE_TOKENR: Oh, I see. So??¬ what I know are Pocari and Gatorade.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Okay. When talking about sports drinks, what can you think of? It might be an object or a person.NEWLINE_TOKENR: Well??¬Sports drinks make me think of a charger. When your mobile phone or other electronic devices are out of battery, you got to use a charger and plug the devices to the socket. Sports drinks are like a charger for humans!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Nice metaphor. Let???s come to the next question. What are the important criteria for selecting sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Well??¬ I usually choose the brand I like. Favour is another criterion that I can think of. I usually choose the sports drinks with mints. Price is also something that I???ll pay attention to. You know. It???s just a drink and I don???t expect that it???s too expensive. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Which brand do you purchase most frequently?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Pocari, I guess.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Why do you choose Pocari among all the other brands?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Well??¬ I already have a feeling that most sports drinks are very alike. Pocari is the first sports drinks that I have ever tried, so I don???t think I am going to switch to other brands very often. Pocari is also available for sale in many places, like the school campus. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Think back to the time when you were buying sports drinks. Where did you get the information about sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Mainly from ads. Sometimes, I may also purchase a certain brand of sports drinks because my friends say that it???s good.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Where do you usually buy sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: In the supermarket or the vending machines in the school campus or shopping malls.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Please comment on the overall quality of Pocari.NEWLINE_TOKENR: It???s quite nice. It???s quite refreshing and the price is reasonable??¬But it???d better if it has more favours, like Lemon-mint.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Can you tell me how your perfect sports drink is?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Well??¬ A perfect sports drink should be quite nutritious and gives a refreshing feeling. It should have a wide range of favours??¬The price should also be reasonable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: If your friends want to buy sports drinks, what advice would you give him/her?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Pay attention to the nutritional values.

I am a member of some sports teams. So, I engage in some regular practices for sports.NEWLINE_TOKENG: But you said that you only have sports drinks about once or twice per month. So, what do you usually drink after doing sports?NEWLINE_TOKENR: I usually drink water. You know, water is much cheaper.NEWLINE_TOKENG: Do you think that sports drinks and water are equally good? NEWLINE_TOKENR: Of course not. I suppose sports drinks can quench my thirst better than water. But, it would be quite costly to buy a bottle sports drink every time after doing sports. For water, I can simply get it from the canteen for free!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Why do you think you would have sports drinks after doing sports?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Well??¬ Sports drinks are the best for quenching my thirst after doing sports. And From the ads, sports drinks are supposed to replenish nutrients and water quickly after doing sports activities.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Please tell me the brands of sports drinks that you know. Name as many as possible.NEWLINE_TOKENR: Redbull, Lucozade, Pocari, Gatorade.NEWLINE_TOKENG: Which Lucozade do you refer to? NEWLINE_TOKENR: The orange ones.NEWLINE_TOKENG: Actually, Redbull and the Lucozade that you mentioned are energy drinks, instead of a sports drink.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: When talking about sports drinks, what can you think of? It might be an object or a person.NEWLINE_TOKENR: What I can think of are athletes, the Olympics and gold medals??¬that sort of things.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: What are the important criteria for selecting sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Favour is my main concern. I like some fruity favour, in particular. Price is also something that I will look at.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Which brand do you purchase most frequently?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Catorade.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Why do you choose Catorade among all the other brands?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Most of my friends say Catorade is the best. So, I just believe them and purchase Catorade. Of course, I did try a number of brands personally and find that Catorade is the best.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Think back to the time when you were buying sports drinks. Where did you get the information about sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: From ads and from friends. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Where do you usually buy sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Mostly in supermarkets.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Please comment on the overall quality of Catorade.NEWLINE_TOKENR: It has a wide range of favours. Grapefruit favour is my favourite. Other brands taste more or less the same. And I think Catorade can really quench my thirst efficiently after doing sports activities. In the past, some Catorade bottles got a mouthpiece that fits our mouth. Such design allows me to drink more easily when doing physical exercises. However, products with such bottles are no longer on sale in Hong Kong. I hope Catorade can resume to its old design, as it would suit the needs of athletes better.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Can you tell me how your perfect sports drink is?NEWLINE_TOKENR: It should quench my thirst pretty quickly after doing sports. It should also have good nutritional values??¬And good designs for the bottle as well??¬something that makes it easier to grip the bottle with my sweaty hands??¬ Also, I hope the price would go down a little bit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: If your friends want to buy sports drinks, what advice would you give him/her?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Purchase those which are rich in water, nutrients and so on.

It???s equally refreshing as having a soft drink in the hot weather. I would also think of my favourite Soccer stars, like Rooney, Gerrard. Their images are consistent with sports drinks.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: What are the important criteria for selecting sports drinks?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Favour. It???s the most important criterion for any types of drinks.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Which brand do you purchase most frequently?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Catorade.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENG: Why do you choose Catorade among all the other brands?NEWLINE_TOKENR: Well??¬ I switch to different soft drinks from time to time.

1	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006. ISSEA sa is then free to confer titles, without that this requires an estimate accreditation or recognition subsidies and must be considered as recognized by national law (judgment of the TAF of 13 August 2013, B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 11). The CRUS, is not responsible neither for accreditation or for recognition under the LAU and the list developed by this authority can be at most a working tool, not expounding this list legal effects (judgment of the TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 13Equni (talk)  Recognition and university accreditation in Switzerland: rulings clarifying The legal issues on the real value of the recognition and accreditation University in Switzerland have been resolved by some judgments of the Swiss Federal Courts. Recognition in the university system The Federal Court judgment with 5A-376/2008 of 7 May 2008 confirmed that the cantonal license to use the name ``university`` is a recognition of the status of universities in the Swiss university system, and say the opposite is true. That judgment has therefore 'refuted the thesis of the Education Department of the Canton Ticino, in the person of Mr. Sandro Rusconi who mistakenly consider it a simple authorization to use the name University accreditation The Federal Court judgment with 2P.88 / 2006 of 20 January 2009 stated that the accreditation is not mandatory and that to pursue the occupation university in Switzerland do not need a state authorization, as well as the non-accreditation or fails such a procedure does not affect in any way the freedom to engage in teaching and research university. The Federal Court Ammnistrativo with judgment B-1567/2011 of February 8, 2012 has confirmed that the university accreditation is a simple quality mark Optional without any legal consequences. In other words it is a recognition of the validity of this or that title or this or that university from the state. That judgment has therefore 'refuted the thesis of the Federal authorities who mistakenly consider him a state recognition and discriminating between accredited and non-accredited universitiesEquni (talk)  University accreditation in Switzerland quality mark 'volunteer without any legal consequences Considerations of the Secretary General of the Conference university Switzerland Excerpt of the considerations of the Secretary General of the Conference university Switzerland Mrs. Martina Weiss in the reply of May 27, 2011 before the Federal Administrative Court in the case relating to our request for accreditation of courses of study.

The CUS Swiss University Conference is the federal body responsible for accrediting university in SwitzerlandEquni (talk)  Value of university degrees awarded by private universities in Switzerland In Switzerland, the university education is mostly public and the individual cantons, unless the federal institutes and other federal universities (SUP) UAS directly regulated and controlled by the federal government, however, there is also a significant presenzadi private universities. Switzerland is not required prior authorization and / or state recognition to provide training in settoreuniversitario, organize examinations or issue qualifications. There is the legal value of the securities. Federal or cantonal authorities, within their respective powers, ensure in cases provided by law on the activities of private universities. In Switzerland, except cases specially regulated by law, the judge of the quality and value ofa training is the user or the labor market before the state. In accordance with the tendenzeinternazionali, were introduced in Switzerland accreditation procedures optional (quality certification and / or quality marks) does not discriminate between public offering and private. Accreditation is voluntary and certifies only a external quality assurance and does not imply any recognition of the validity of Questa of that training by the state. The university sector in Switzerland is complex and consequent to the Eurosystem's federal country (A tertiary according classificazioneinternazionale): the federal government regulates and controls the Federal Institutes of Technology and the Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) pubblicheo private. The cantons, according to the Federal Constitution of Switzerland, have sovereignty over the cantonal public universities and private ones operating in its territorio.In each canton then there are laws that govern the cantonal universities so different matter. The Confederation and the cantons have common skills regarding the coordination and development of quality, through the Swiss University Conference (CUS), joint body of university policy academic public. Nationally a Swiss national accreditation agency (OAQ), optionally accredits public universities and private chloro individual curricula, that gives them a quality mark, which however does not in itself confer any recognition and / or the validity of state titles conferred. An institution may apply for accreditation as a university or can 'take credit for certain courses of study only as required by federal law opening Evening University (LAU, RS 414.20). Regarding the value of the securities issued in Switzerland university academics: for the purposes of the exercise of a regulated profession (eg medicine, advocacy, etc.), are cantonal or federal laws regulating the profession that determine which titolisono recognized. For unregulated professions (eg, management, journalism, etc.) Is up to the fact aldatore work ``recognize`` whether or not the value of a degree; significant may be the accreditation or at least a quality certification issued by private entities generally recognized. For the purpose of further studies, is the university where you will continue its work that recognizes the value of a previous title. As is the case for equivalence of qualifications, universities are based on national standards. Private universities recognized to belong to the teaching system based in Switzerland, although not accredited (ie that did not require quality certification optional), however, have the constitutional right to grant university degrees who, without any difference from those issued by public universities, are valid for: the right of access for the purpose of continuation of studies in the university system (public) in Switzerland and abroad, in accordance with national laws and the Lisbon Convention of 1997, the Council of Europe on the mutual recognition of qualifications; for the exercise of regulated professions in Switzerland under the directive of the European Union CE / 2005/36 into force in Switzerland on 1 November 2011; for the purpose of Switzerland's non-regulated professions, that is the free assessment of the companyEquni (talk) `"

If so, what should it be replaced with?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== Claim of bias and proposal for fix ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis subsection addresses a serious POV problem with the current version of Chiropractic, namely, heavy bias in its discussion of the effectiveness of chiropractic care. Much of the problem has been discussed extensively on this talk page for weeks, so far with no consensus. This subsection is an attempt to gather the issues together in one spot and propose a solution. This is a controversial issue that may require some work to resolve; please bear with the following exposition as it covers many issues.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo help other editors follow this discussion better, please place comments below, after the the proposal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==== POV in existing coverage ====NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of chiropractic care, and Chiropractic should present the evidence fairly without giving undue weight to minority views. Unfortunately Chiropractic currently falls seriously short of this goal. Here is a summary of POV problems in Chiropractic's treatment of effectiveness:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Chiropractic gives a section to the Manga report, a 1993 effectiveness paper highly favorable to chiropractic that was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. Chiropractic does not mention the widespread peer-reviewed criticism of the Manga report (for example, ``The Manga report was not a controlled clinical trial but a review of the literature that offered an opinion that has not been experimentally established.`` in Grod et al. 2001, PMID 11677551). In any event, the Manga report was long ago superseded by higher-quality work and is not now a reliable source for effectiveness.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Chiropractic gives a section to worker's compensation studies that, like the Manga report, are old, disputed, and strongly pro-chiropractic. Contrary evidence is widely available in peer-reviewed journals, e.g., Hess & Mootz 1999 (PMID 10395430), Johnson et al. 1999, but Chiropractic does not mention it. Again, this material is obsolescent and low quality by today's standards, and is not now a reliable source.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Chiropractic gives two sections (Chiropractic#American Medical Association (AMA) and Chiropractic#British Medical Association) that mention old endorsements about effectiveness and referrals. This material might be worth putting into the Chiropractic history subpage here, but it is way too much detail here, and it gives the mistaken impression that the old AMA statement reflects the best current science on effectiveness.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Chiropractic#Scientific investigation repeats material from Chiropractic#Philosophy that (aside from being redundant) has little to do with scientific investigation: it approvingly describes some antiscientific components of chiropractic philosophy, which is POV. The section's second paragraph is highly dated (it talks about grant funding in 1994 and 1995, which again is material suitable for Chiropractic history but not here) and talks with almost entirely approving note about chiropractic research (again, POV coverage of a controversial subject). The section's third paragraph is entirely unsourced; that is not POV in itself, but it is a worrisome sign.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn short, Chiropractic's coverage of effectiveness (a core topic) is currently weak and is heavily biased in favor of chiropractic.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Again, please place further comments below.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==== Criticisms of earlier proposed fix ====NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo help fix this I proposed Effectiveness 1, a draft section on effectiveness that relies on recent high-quality scientific sources, along with a proposal to remove the obsolescent material. This draft has been discussed extensively in Draft effectiveness section and #An appeal: Drop the ``effectiveness`` discussion, so far with no consensus. To help move matters forward I have drafted a new section below, #Effectiveness 2, which attempts to respond to some (but not a"

Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections launching a coup d'??tat in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship.

With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, being the Democracy ``reinstated`` by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Having returned to power democratically elected at the end of 1950, Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::  `"

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLong-winded:NEWLINE_TOKENI can understand how it can be upsetting and such when you have the info and no one wants to listen.  It's quite alright in the way you responded.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow for fonts and colors in signatures...  For colors, I go here.  I choose the worded colors because it's easier to tell someone else what the color is.  The code fo this would be:  WORD .  I used blue in the example but you can use any color you wish.  This is what the example would look like:  WORD .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor fonts the code is:  Comic Sans MS .  I used Comic Sans MS in the example.  The result is:  Comic Sans MS .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor both you can combine:  Comic Sans MS .  Result: Comic Sans MS.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow for a signature.  In order for you signature to take people to your Userpage and such, you'll have to link it in the signature bar under preferences.  So, let's say you wanted your sig to take someone to your Userpage, but you wanted the letter ``t`` to link to your talk page.  This is how you would link it:  .  This is how it would look: .  Note: the letter ``t`` is bold because this is your Talk page, otherwise it would look like the others.  To add colors and fonts, you place the code after the vertical bar (|) in the links.  So let's make the name in Times New Roman with a red color and have the Talk page link blue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis would be the code:  .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd the result: .  Again the ``t`` is bold because this is your Talk page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou would place this code (or one of your choosing, of course) in the signature bar under your preferences.  Then click on ``Raw Signature`` and Save.  You can create links to any of you sub-pages you have as well and use as many colors as you want.  But the more links and colors you use, the longer the sig will look in ``wiki markup`` and could cause someone to complain.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  Sorry for this long winded explanation.  I hope this helps.  -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Many thanks, Yoshi. Sometimes, a long-winded explanation is the best one.

1	"NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Avi. We have extensive sources for Jewish/Israeli points of view, far more than for the P of I/P. Some of them, like the Algemeiner and several others, look rather pointy, but I don't challenge them, except of course if the specific article is obviously questionable. As to Mondoweiss, I've asked RSN twice about using it with attribution recently, for specific contexts. Unfortunately the usual line-up on each side (some socks) disenchanted external advice, but on each occasion, one independent editor or so would say that it can be used in context, depending on the quality of the article and its editor. The same holds for +972 magazine (Mairav Zonszein is published by the New York Times, most of the contributors have worked on desks at Haaretz and Jerusalem Post etc.,) As Kingsindian noted, the idea that there is an absolute veto, and that editors who (caught out twice in my memory) never examined the article they removed from that source, but see 'Mondoweiss' or '+972' and revert, is peculiar. I certainly don't think once should consider them automatically RS but in borderline areas, a courtesy note on the page discussing the article and editor, and crosschecking to see if the claim is exceptional, or merely one of those things underreported by the mainstream, but not in itself  improbable, is what is required. At [[Skunk (weapon)|]Skunk] sometime back a now banned editor challenged the idea that that liquid was only used against Palestinians in the West Bank. He came up with an article in Hebrew in a non-RS source that had a photo that confirmed that Haredis had been at least once, in Israel (West Jerusalem). So, I re-edited that source back in. It looked, whatever RS rigourism might say, a fair  documentation of a fact otherwise difficult to establish in mainstream sources. Commonsense should be the rule.  "

1	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Final Edit ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSince I'll never be editing Wikipedia again, I thought I'd add a few notes here for the benefit of the few people involved who aren't delusional.  One day, I logged on to discover that I had been accused of being someone else and was facing being banned as a result.  When I objected, instead of being banned for being someone else, I was banned for objecting.  The person who did the banning had been carrying a grudge for literally years, having been caught trying to ban me for similar ludicrously and transparently self-serving reasons years earlier, only to have his malicious action overturned.  In the years since he had been initially caught, the administrators who had cared one way or the other slowly dropped away as Wikipedia slid into its own navel.  A larger and larger proportion of Wikipedia's dwindling contributions are being directed towards bureaucracy and petty politics.  This is always the sign of a community rapid decline.  I do not anticipate that Wikipedia will be relevant for much longer, though it may linger for decades as an increasingly toxic MMORPG for authoritarian sperglords.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe proof that this ban has nothing to do with my contributions and everything to do with my legitimate criticism of Wikipedia is that my user page (containing criticism of the systemic biases within Wikipedia and the noxious atmosphere within its community  which had already survived one attempt at censorship through official channels) was gleefully blanked once I no longer had the power to fix it, complete with mocking ``buh-bye`` commentary.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEric Hoffer wrote, ``You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.``  I never cared about Wikipedia; I came here because a blatantly libellous biography about me had sat untouched for months and only when it was corrected to make it factually correct, only then action was taken to have it removed on the basis of being a ``non-notable`` and a ``vanity`` article.  In the years since that initial experience, nothing I've experienced has done anything to contradict my distaste with the bullying, authoritarian culture within Wikipedia, and serves to confirm my suspicions about the sort of society Randroids like Jimbo would like to foist on us.  It is, however, telling that the worst punishment Wikipedia's brownshirt enforcers can think to enforce upon me is to prevent me from contributing to their project.  If I was a troll and an agent provocateur, clearly I wouldn't care and, in any case, could easily create more accounts.  I know several people who do just that.  It's obvious that the people who want so desperately to silence me and my unthinkable criticism of the wildly dysfunctional culture within Wikipedia don't really think I'm a troll or a sock puppeteer or whatever other excuses they've dragged up for silencing me; it's that I infuriatingly refuse to consider it some kind of glorious reward to give free labour to Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt's an odd situation, to be forcefully barred from rowing the oars on a sinking ship, for the apparently inexcusable crime of noting that the ship is sinking.  Even now, I suspect that this final commentary will be removed, because the presence of discordant voices inside the echo chamber of Wikipedia is intolerable, even when those voices are trying to draw attention to a problem which will ultimately destroy the very community which is providing the milieu in which the echo chamber ostensibly exists to protect.  Some of the people involved clearly have a long and well-documented history of cognitive distortions which leave them largely unable to either control or be held morally culpable for their actions.  It's not these people, the sadly delusional acolytes of Jimbo, to whom I address this, but the few remaining people within Wikipedia who have closed their eyes to what's occuring.  I don't have any desire to be re-chained to the oars, so this isn't about shaming anyone into overturning the decision of the kangaroo court which silenced me on Wikipedia.  This is about getting the more-or-less sane people to feel some sense of personal responsibility for refusing to either make the attempt to stand up to the bullies or remove themselves from the culture which fosters and supports the bullies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN   `"

I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues. I hope this post brings to you a greater understanding of copyright of images and will serve you in your future editing.  "

1	"`predominantly an inherited very talented right brain and to some degree an immature left brain   As the visio-spacial dominant brain supports the opposite of the body, being right brained dominant would usually make the person have a tendency to being left handed. Leonardo was left handed. The natural tendency for the majority of people with a dominant left language brain would be to work from the left dominant brain towards the right side making it natural to write from left to right. However if the right brain was dominant as in ADHD, the tendency would be to write from right to left. Leonardo used mirror righting for this reason. Children with ADHD often reverse letters especially the ??úb??Ñ and ??úd??Ñ, and are often left handed and are also often musical and artistic like Leonardo.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe right brain has talent for art, music, creative inventive and practical handy man ability. Leonardo had all of this. The left brain is the language, formal learning, organized, listening brain focusing on the spoken word.  Leonardo had no or little formal learning.  The right brain is particularly hasty and easily distracted with a poor concept of time. This certainly describes Leonardo if one considers how often he never finished a painting. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith a talented right brain he would also drift from one place to another, never quite settling down. The right brain seems to master mechanical maths very easily and Leonardo was self taught. However story sums (word sums) are done with the left language brain and not easily mastered. The right brain is a very physical brain endowering the person with clear physical abilities and often muscular strength.  Leonardo was allegedly a physically strong person. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ability to use body language from the right brain  in preference to the spoken word from the left would allow a right brained person to   express him self  visually and spatially with great depth and accuracy.

Leonardo was an illegitimate child. It would seem there is more than enough to diagnose ADHD posthumously in the great gifted artist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen a psychometric evaluation is done on an ADHD person the non verbal IQ (right brain) is invariably higher than the verbal IQ (left brain.) This is hardly surprising. It can be assumed the artist must have had a gifted IQ   to have done what he was able to do without any formal learning.  He did not need any formal learning for his immature left brain. His creative, artist right brain would allow him to be drawn to art and benefit immensely and enthusiastically from any training he might receive in this field.  He certainly did, even outdoing his teachers.   Einstein and Churchill both had formal learning thrust on them with limited success. Their Visio-spacial brains excelled. The talented right brain often results in hyperactive behavior problems. Churchill and Einstein had behavior problems and Churchill also showed considerable artistic talent. The badly behaved  the visio-special temperamental tennis player, John McEnroe who was also left handed and he certainly able to   express himself with is talented right  brain using rather body language in preference to verbal. Smashing a tennis racket is certainly good body language. The artistically gifted   Michael Angelo was also left handed. So was Mozart and Beethoven.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI as a non diagnosed left handed ADHD person can well remember my problematical early education during the war years when children wrote on slate to save paper. As I wrote across the slate with my left hand I smudged my work as my hand moved across the slate. I did not revert to mirror writing but I certainly confused the letters ??úb??Ñ and ??úd??Ñ (reversals). I received no sympathetic understanding from the ignorant teachers. Luckily my left handed genetically inherited mechanically gifted son was not only recognised but successfully treated. So was the artistically talented Churchill. One wonders what Leonardo might have achieved with correct effective modern medical treatment? Leonardo???s mirror writing was certainly due to a talent many ADHD people have in giving preference to the left hand and easily adapt to using mirror writing. They have a natural talent for reversing the written word. NEWLINE_TOKENDr. W.J. Levin.  ??÷Preceding unsigned comment added by   ???

I would like to clarify, though, that tax protester arguments are thrown out of court not just ``virtually every time``, but every single time. There are no exceptions. No tax protester has ever succeeded in ``proving`` that there is no obligation to pay income tax. What you might be thinking of as exceptions are the few occasions where courts have found tax protesters to be ignorant of the law, and thus not willfully committing a crime. However, even where people are acquitted of criminal behavior, this is not because the court has found the lack of a law requiring payment of taxes, and those persons have still been required to pay the taxes owed, with substantial fees and penalties added on. Cheers!   `"

(Earlier, I'd posted here the AP article on Wikipedia from Dec 12, 2005.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn what has become a huge coincidence, the very day the media begins reporting on the dangers of Wikipedia, happens to be the day immediately after the very week I discovered misinformation and falsehoods being posted on this page about nitrites, and then tried to edit them by attempting to add more accurate information, but then was attacked and harassed by another person who disagrees with my edits  and was ultimately blocked and threatened by a purported Wikipedia administrator.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs was reported in the news today, people can go to http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/ to learn more about how Wikipedia functions, and where the dangers exist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe folks at wikipediawatch report that, what's happening in Wikipedia, is that any collection of citations that may APPEAR balanced is all that anybody expects. If the title or snippet in a link itself contributes to this impression, then the full text is not researched by anyone.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is exactly what has been going on in this nitrite page.  As a result, it truly is, as wikipediawatch reminds us, ``garbage in, garbage out, garbage back in...``  and after a few cycles of this, it all turns into `` a big, stinking heap``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTruly, as the news media warned today: ``Don't believe eveyrthing you read on the Web, especially on Wikipedia!``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe following two posts, found in a wikipediareview blog, sum up my experiences this past week, after having been harassed, threatened and finally blocked, after I attempted to add to the body of knowledge about nitrites/poppers.  They demonstrate how dangerous Wikipedia  based on its current model  really is:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Wikipedia's procedural faults, complete anarchy as regards contributions, and sometimes-bizzare social rules do not teach people to become good researchers or writers... it teaches them how to be good Wikipedians, or to get the hell out.`` - Jason ScottNEWLINE_TOKEN``. . . when it comes to history and politics, Wikipedia can claim whatever it wants by shutting out those who actually know something about a certain topic. In that way, Wikipedia can rewrite history as it sees fit - which may have nothing to do with reality or the actual facts.`` - SummerFRNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFinally, this post on a board, discussing wikipedia, really sets it out well:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Any moron can pretty well say anything they want on any topic, which is fine for a News Group or a Forum but not an Encyclopedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn my opinion a reference source should be authoritative enough to end arguments not start them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe that Wikipedia could better serve the internet community if they checked their facts first before publishing the article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInstead, we have a situation where the cart is placed before the horse and we end up with what is left by the horse.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNuf said.`"

0	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Go out in a blaze of glory...on my own talk page???  No, that's not my intention at all.  It's a very small venue to go out on, I can assure you.  My intention is simply to tell the truth.  Even if it hurts.  On that, I don't compromise.  If that appears suidical to you, it's a sad indictment on the frequency of truth telling in you neck of the woods.  Others compromise on truth, often because they care about $$$ more than truth.  That's what I believe motivates the deletions on WP and elsewhere regarding monetary reform.  That's why this stuff isn't EVER published in ``mainstream`` sources.  This stuff is starved of funds until it dies.  People who care about $$$ more than truth hate people pointing this out to them.  Because it hurts.  It shows they aren't very smart, but they are very selfish.  It's as simple as that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::One other thing.  Wealth distribution is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of money creation and distribution.  They are related and they do interact, but they are distinct issues.  Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and ``just`` and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.  `"

For either a photon or a particle of a given mass, the speed is uniquely determined by the energy or momentum, and only one number (the energy or momentum) is needed to describe the relevant differences between different particles.

1	"`NEWLINE_TOKEN::For what it's worth, I suggest you refrain from pushing the ``socks`` remarks around, as it only seems to add fuel to the matter. Given that an SPI has been opened and Checkuser denied due to Stale accounts and behaviour evidence alone, it serves no purpose to accuse him further, just as it serves no purpose for him to accuse you of stalking. No one is going to win that type of argument. Also, I suggest you stop calling cowboy ``Jake`` from now on, as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. Clearly he is determined to push his case, and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. Socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. But if you give them enough rope, they'll eventually hang themselves with it. Challenging suspected socks non-stop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation. SPI does not support the claim at present, and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf, whatever the outcome. I'm sure, by ``rotating IP`` he probably means proxies. It isn't important though. Cheers, ?ß[?ß????ßRFF] `"

We have a policy, which can be seen at WP:BURDEN, that says The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. You may remove any material lacking a reliable source that directly supports it. Wikipedia requires that things be proven with reliable sources. If you can find a reliable source that backs up your information, that will solve all of this and would most likely allow the inclusion of the information in the article.  I think that should be your top priority regarding the article.  Thank you. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Second half, Sudoghost:  I had done so beforehand.  I guess I should back up and explain the whole thing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The dispute is about the scheduling of matches on Wrestlemania XXVIII.  The original list had one match, The Rock vs. John Cena, which was agreed to in a promo the Monday after Wrestlemania XXVII, the first time such a thing had been done that far in advance.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from ``wrestling``, won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!   `"

These scholars say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the First Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying ``Theos Epiphanes`` (God manifest), etc. Even those who advocate an interpretation of Daniel that includes the Roman Empire in their interpretations of Daniel recognize Antiochus as a prototype of ``antichrist.``http://www.endtime-truth.com/studies2.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Revelation  and , John borrowed the ``Son of Perdition`` concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to ``the star that fell from heaven`` Revelation  by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. (Revelation ) The Greek name is ``Apollyon`` (Greek: A??????????????), from the Greek root word ``apollumi`` (Greek:????????????????) It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation.`` [Strong's 622] The Hebrew name is ``Abaddon`` (Greek: A????????????), from the Aramaic root word ``'abad`` (Hebrew transliteration:??????), which means the same thing as the Greek root word. [Strong's 07] Daniel  says that the eventual destiny of the ``great beast`` is to be slain, and his body ``destroyed`` ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (generally accepted by religious scholars to be a reference to hell).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the ``son of perdition``. The New International Version translates the phrase as ``the one doomed to destruction.`` D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563. The phrase is also used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where it is equated with the Man of Sin.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Third frame of reference: Antichrist===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 2 Thessalonians , Paulwriting well after both Jesus and Judas had come and gone to their respective destiniesreferred to ``the Son of Perdition`` in some future sense from the point in time in which he wrote his epistle. He also equated this person with the Man of Sin.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLikewise, In Revelation  and , John, writing well after Jesus and Judas Iscariot had come and gone to their respective destinies, refers to ``the beast that goeth into perdition.`` Assuming a futuristic mode of interpretation, this would also be a reference to a future figure.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn some variations of Christian eschatology, this future figure is commonly referred to as ``antichrist,`` the ``false messiah,`` or the ``false christ.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Applications===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe following statements are archetypal, and do not reflect every organizational or individual variation:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVarious sects of Jews and Christians, as well as secular historians and higher critics would acknowledge the"

Even ignoring that the case for 2 horses fails, this is not mathematical induction anyway.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCompare with this: If we had a proof (P) that all horses are white we could prove that one horse is white.

I will give you extreme examples to you now; ``Ottoman was a European country when it was at its most expanded territorial state`` is that right or wrong?

With this constraint the angular acceleration is also zero, and the only term which includes moment of inertia is eliminated.

0	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Well, in general, using examples from other articles will not be helpful, because there is a lack of consistency.  In fact, the article about Kodokan Judo is currently at Kodokan, and Itto-ryu is currently at Itt??-ry??.  Please be aware of the difference, though, between arts where the name of the martial art practiced (such as ``judo`` or ``kenjutsu``) is a part of the name of the school, and where it is just describing the school.  If it is part of the school's ``official`` name, it should be capitalized, and be included in the name of the article.  If it is not part of the school's official name, it should not even be part of the article's title, much less capitalized. Thus, I believe (and I could be mistaken) that Kodokan should actually be moved to Kodokan Judo, while Itt??-ry?? should stay where it is.  A good rule of thumb might be, if you were to go to Japan, and look at the sign hanging over the front door, what would it say.  I suppose Itto-ryu might included ``Kenjutsu`` after it, but certainly any of the comprehensive koryu would have only the name of the school.  Daito-ryu, on the other hand, seems to clearly use ``Aikijujutsu`` as part of its name.  There's even a great old photo of Morihei Ueshiba from the 1930s, sitting in seiza in front of a sword stand and a hanging banner that reads (in kanji, of course) ``Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Regarding the hyphen in ``aiki-jujutsu``, I may have actually been the one to add that originally.  It's purely a personal preference issue.  There are no rules regarding hyphens in Hepburn romanization, their use is up to the judgment of the writer to include them wherever they help to improve clarity.  I felt that an English-speaking reader with no Japanese experience might have a hard time with ``aikijujutsu``, because all of the repetitive vowels kind of make the word blur together, and it is a logical place to break the word up, without making it look like two entirely separate words. Or putting it another way, it makes ``aikijujutsu`` readily identifiable as a compound word, and clearly shows the two root words.  I am not at all attached to doing it this way, though, and would have no problem with them all being changed back to ``aikijujutsu``, if anyone feels strongly about it.  `"

1	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Solution ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is save Venice, and I created a makeshift account under SV Solution. I have no intention in keeping it, nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages. After this statement, I will be closing it and just be Save venice. This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal- how stupid.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now  with no end in sight, here is a solution (step by step):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) I have looked into all of your backgrounds, and none of you are Venetain experts, please stick with what you know, and don't muck up good articles. Most of you are only interested in hoaxes, and seem you to enjoy talking about them, Stop doing that- it is not a solution. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) Having also looked into the background of this situation,  it is clear where the hoax is coming from, Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois. Vitus must have went there, and these kids knew him or knew of him, they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page, and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with. Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society, and the hoax is then neutralized. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Go to the Fenwick H.S. talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff., If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into an upper file, so it is there but out of the way, it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4) go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same, now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5) If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article, it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN6) If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc. It should be fair game to be removed. They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN7) I have also looked over the previous page you sent me, and the knowledge on that was also good, Spretti goes into detail about the family's Roman roots etc. It can be referenced, but I am not going to reference other peoples work, return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top. It is a good over-view of the family, and it is enough, if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN8) Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links, and I will work closely with our expert on that, there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro. Also, red links show where further development needs to occur- there may be other people out there that has info too. Red links are useful. If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links, but leave them there there are useful to direct development.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN9) Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax. The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio, it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN10) Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices, be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN11) My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward. I will not play childish games or be treated in this manner. I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic, next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice. My focus is not just on the Barbaro family, I am happy to fix it and then move on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRELATED ISSUES:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem, nor do I believe that that even occured, I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia. What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this (at Fenwick H.S.) and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid- she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character. I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some ``Expert`` to fix a Wikipedia article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) I am NOT misguided, I know this family's history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads. You will also find more info out there about Antonio's line because in Malta, titles are still holding political power, while in Vitus'case they are cultural titles devoid of powers. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Finally, Antonio's branch is 100% the same family from Venice. Spretti p277: ``Ramo di questa famiglia fiorisce tuttora a Malta.`` Beginning of the Malta line that flurishd completely in Malta. I know what I am talking about- I am an expert on this topic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, stop talking and sending worthless blocks and follow the guidelines above and you wiil have a solution, and if Wikipedia can't do that, than I will not be editing with Wikipedia any longer- it would mean that it is too uneffective and problematic to deal with for any kind of enjoyable involvement. Yours truly, Save venice. `"

If a reference says that X is the case we cannot read it as saying otherwise, and if it is silent on whether X is the case we cannot interpret it as either supporting or not supporting X. That's the rule and it's a very firm rule.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Please don't delete or edit other people's comments ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCheeseDreams, please don't delete or edit other people's comments on the Talk pages. You've done it to me personally twice now (that I've noticed), once in the talk page of the Cultural and Historical Jesus, and (at least) once before on the Wikiproject:Jesus discussion page, when you made most of the discussion of Christology in the strikethrough font. You seem to be relatively new to Wikipedia, so I'm asking nicely. Say what you need to say, but let others say what they say and let their words stand on their own. Thank you.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you mean a comment in the summary, that is because I summarised the text. Your comments can be viewed at archives 2-5.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And on Wikiproject:Jesus, I struckthrough (but did not delete) items which had been actioned. This is the standard practice for todo lists is it not?NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I meant the comment on the summary itself, encouraging people to read those archives instead of relying on someone's summary. On Wikiproject:Jesus, the text you marked as strikethrough were not part of a todo list, it was a discussion of whether to do anything with Christology at all. In both cases it appears that you were trying to delete or conceal my objections to your proposals, rather than actually respond to them. Maybe that wasn't your intention, but it certainly had that appearance.  \NEWLINE_TOKEN:::It already says that the full text is in the archive, and that the summary is by me, and disputed by you.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::W.r.t. the wikiproject, if you note the talk page, you will see that I struck through everywhere that there was discussion which I had actioned. If I had intended to delete or conceal your objections, I would merely have deleted the text, or put    tags round it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Also regarding your summary of Slrubenstein's comments, ``yanking someone's chain`` doesn't have anything to do with masturbation in the U.S., at least when used in the context Slrubenstein used it. It just means he wondered if FT2 were saying things just to get a reaction from him. That's probably an honest misunderstanding between the two of you, but it might be helpful if you acknowledged it and corrected that part of your summary. Thanks.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::If Slrubenstein agrees to retract his uncivility toward FT2 such as ``charicature of a nut``, ``ar eyanking my chain``, ``your reasoning is specious and ignorant``, and apologise for them, then I am perfectly willing to remove the comments from the summary. Until that time, they remain, since this is how I and other non-US (remember that the majority of english speakers are not in the US) readers read the text.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I have also just looked the phrase up in a slang dictionary, and cannot find an alternative meaning to the phrase.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: I agree, most English speakers are outside the US, so it's a very understandable misunderstanding. Here are links to a couple of definitions that I think are better than the one I gave, and probably closer to what SLR meant: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yank+one's+chain and http://www.ozyvoyuer.com/aussieslangdictionary.html#Y. (The second looks Australian, so it's not a strictly US-centric usage.)   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Arbitration==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks for pointing me in the direction of the RfA. A lot of familiar names in that crew! I don't know that I'd call them a cabal but I know what you mean. They've learned that the best way to push a POV is to gather a small gang. The way Wikipedia is structured it's easy to subvert consensus by doing so. I'll try to have a look at what's passed and if I can comment constructively, I'll do that.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegarding arbitration, CheeseDreams, I was not implying at all that I didn't agree that I should recuse myself  I did so, as I hope you noticed.  I was noting that it is Arbitration Committee practice for someone involved peripherally in a dispute (or directly, of course) to recuse themselves, and that in the past no one has needed to prompt arbitrators to do this.  We're intelligent, we're committed to fairness, and we police ourselves pretty effectively in this regard.  I was just wishing you'd have given me the courtesy of waiting to see if I would recuse myself from the case, rather than assuming I wouldn't.  I will note, though, that the standard you suggest is generally considered too high for arbitration here.  In a case like yours, it's obvious that with so many involved parties (in a relatively small community), all of those people will know at least one arbitrator  mere acquaintance does not require an arbitrator to recuse.  We recuse when we're involved in the case itself, or when one of the involved parties is either a long time enemy or close friend.  If arbitrators could only hear cases involving users they had never before encountered, we couldn't arbitrate any case effectively.  Just thought I'd offer my thoughts, and let you take them as you please.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn another note, I am not sure if it was you who wrote the phrase ``cabal of 'fundamentalists'`` in your arbitration request, but if you did, I'd suggest to you that it might be wise not to use that phrase.  The list of users who oppose you includes at least one very dedicated atheist and at least one other person who is openly hostile to Christianity  characterizing the list as ``fundamentalist`` will be seen as a blanket generalization.  Obviously you can do as you please, but I think other users will notice the word and the users, as I did, and be confused or else draw negative assumptions (i.e., characterizing atheists as ``fundamentalists`` might be seen as an indication that one is hasty to judgment, etc.).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, I'm sure you don't much like getting a note from me, so I'll disappear, but if you ever do feel like talking, I want you to know that I'd be happy to.  As I hope you can see above, I'm not ``out to get you``.  I'd like to understand you a little better, and I'd like to be able to work with you productively if I can.  If you'd like to talk about it, drop me a .  Thanks,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Unlike most of the arbitration committee, as far as I am aware, you have actually engaged in debate over controversial issues with me. I regard that as being ``an involved party``.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:No, I wrote the phrase 'cabal of ``fundamentalists``', please note the quotes around the word ``fundamentalist``NEWLINE_TOKEN:I have absolutely no issue with getting a note from you.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I'm glad  here's another note then.  You seem to misunderstand me (perhaps I'm not communicating well).  I have agreed with you on two separate pages already that I most certainly am an involved party.  I don't want to sound at all rude, but I have to admit that your continued responses to me are making me wonder if you understand what I mean when I say that I have ``recused`` myself from the case.  If I am wrong, please forgive my suggestion.  But if you are unclear on what it means, it means that I have openly declared that I am an involved party and that I will not offer any arbitrator opinions (or any votes) on your case, should it be accepted.  I apologize if it is unclear  I had thought that ``recuse`` was common in the English court system as well, but I confess I do not know it well, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  As far as the quotation marks around ``fundamentalist``...well, as I said, it's your choice.  I can't claim that I understand what difference in meaning is implied by the quotes, but I don't suppose it's important for me to understand.  Thanks for replying nicely  I apprecia"
