1	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah?ÇÖs witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn?ÇÖt even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it?ÇÖs in a pro-JW website, ?Ç£strictly genteel?Ç¥, which transcribed the noted WT book ?Ç£Is the Bible Really the Word of God??Ç¥, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I?ÇÖm still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That?ÇÖs what?ÇÖs stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And ?Ç£The World History of the Jewish People?Ç¥.   At least that?ÇÖs he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill?ÇÖs book says this:   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:?Ç£When we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh?ÇÖs army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening?ÇÖs entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences?Çöliterary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material?Çöbetween Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Cahill continues:   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place ?Ç£once upon a time?Ç¥?Çöin other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening?Çöit is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time?Çöbeyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity?Çöa concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right?Çöthat convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.?Ç¥    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:He makes it pretty clear that, even though not saying it dogmatically, he does "

It is then that the movie is a remake of the final battle of The Damnbusters.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Damnbusters is 1954 Micheal Anderson film depicting a battle in which british bombers make attack runs at low altitude along a river trench to launch bouncing bombs at precise moments to destroy nazi damns.  They are harried by enemy fighters and guns mounted on the damns.  Even the targeting methods they use are strikingly similar to the targeting computers used in star wars.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you wish to be accurate and fair you should give credit to both Kurosawa and Michael Anderson.  If you watch both movies you will see that Star Wars is not loosely remade of either one, but it is a remake of both.  It is two thirds Hidden Fortress/one third Damnbusters.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am a huge fan of Star Wars and George Lucas.  His great gift was taking two old, totally unrelated, stories and creating the greatest sci-fi movie of all time.  He introduced many new, rich, bold, characters and created an entire saga around this one remake.  I just feel very strongly that credit should be given where credit is due.  I appluad you for giving credit to Akira Kurosawa and ask you extend the same courtesy to Michael Anderson."

Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors.

First of all, it's sourced. Secondly, the term is in quotation marks both in the reference and the body of our article. This is a common way of marking neologisms. A lot of transgender-related words are neologisms, of course. Note that WP:NEO does not proscribe neologisms as such; it's more about having standalone articles on neologisms. If someone were going around introducing ``deadnaming`` in other articles (e.g., ``People deadname Chelsea Manning by calling her Bradley``), that would probably not be appropriate. But since it's specifically discussed as a word at Transphobia, there's really nothing wrong with it.   `"

1	"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===In Response===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear ?Ç£Lessheard vanU?Ç¥ and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia?ÇÖs own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don?ÇÖt apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices.    ?Ç£Lessheard vanU?Ç¥ had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a ?Ç£harassing the editor?Ç¥, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all ?Ç£talk & discussion?Ç¥ are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs previously written in discussion, per wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  ?Ç£Lessheard vanU?Ç¥, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn?ÇÖt follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn?ÇÖt make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia?ÇÖs own written ?Ç£neutral?Ç¥ policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen with IP?ÇÖs being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It?ÇÖs a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you ?Ç£Lessheard vanU?Ç¥ wrote that you don?ÇÖt want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as ?Ç£vandals?Ç¥ and ?Ç£harassing the editors?Ç¥ etc...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOther editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include ?Ç£SVTCobra?Ç¥ and ?Ç£Whoville?Ç¥ and ?Ç£Chris Mann?Ç¥.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and administrators have a conflict of interest to various articles.   So since you  ?Ç£Lessheard vanU?Ç¥ have personally chosen to block IP addresses and made false allegations against me and other contributing people, we are requesting clarification.   When did Blackpearl14 become owner, controller and self judge of certain wikipedia articles?  If you believe that Blackpearl14 owns and has absolute control over Pirates of the Caribbean articles, then please state that is the policy.  Why is Blackpearl14 allowed to violate wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices and purpose?  Why are other editors and administrators upholding double standards?  For you can?ÇÖt have double standards, as the wikipedia written policies detail a cooperative community effort for articles and, it?ÇÖs suppose to be neutral. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, there is no way to discuss nor talk about the reckless actions of Blackpearl14 without saying and describing what they are.  Yet, immediately, Blackpearl14 has wrongly and irresponsibly calls anyone placing anything critical or changes to certain pages she had appointed herself as self controller of, as ?Ç£vandals?Ç¥ and outright claims that she is being ?Ç£attacked?Ç¥, and then goes to her peers with which to delete the talk and discussion,  leaving only the editors and administrators?ÇÖ comments and self bias online, while blocking IP?ÇÖs.   What is shocking that you don?ÇÖt know who I nor other contributing writers are.    Why are Blackpearl14 actions being upheld?    Why is her emotional state, calling herself various names in fantasy as she selfishly promotes her personal cause to glorify and promote a cause for her love for Pirates of the Caribbean and it?ÇÖs people, all to go unquestioned?   Blackpearl14 has proven she is not able to be neutral, is completely bias while preventing other contributing writers to adding facts and information to the wikipedia articles she claims she owns and controls.   ?Ç£Whoville?Ç¥ and ?Ç£SVTCobra?Ç¥ have also proven their bias and double standards practices.   If Blackpearl14 owns and controls those articles, then why does editors and administrators prevent and block other contributing writers from creating their own articles of the same subject, and why are we held to different standards than Blackpearl14?   Why are double standards being used against  contributing writers who follow wikipedia?ÇÖs own written policies and purposes? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen following wikipedia?ÇÖs own written rules, as recorded, discussion ?Ç£talk?Ç¥ was created to confront these issues and serious charges and threats against contributing people.  Yet Blackpearl14 simply gets you to immediately block IP addresses and threaten more.   Then she gives you an award saying that she is thanking you for protecting her from being ?Ç£attacked?Ç¥.   Are you aware of wikipedia?ÇÖs own written polices about communications?    Us contributing writers are well aware of them.  Have you read this one ?Ç£when in doubt, don?ÇÖt delete?Ç¥?   Proper and detailed wikipedia communications procedures were followed yet you ?Ç£Lessheard vanU?Ç¥ have followed her reckless actions, giving her more unchecked power, control and validation.   This is both reckless and dangerous.  There are written policies that you broke when you outright deleted the ?Ç£talk?Ç¥ and ?Ç£discussion?Ç¥.  But evidently you don?ÇÖt care.   Either there are the written policies of Wikipedia to be followed or by the actions of wikipedia?ÇÖs editors and administrators have proven it is overrun by double standards, corruption and recklessness.  Wikipedia?ÇÖs purpose isn?ÇÖt to create kings, queens and monarchies, upholding double standards, and playing power trip games, unless that is the editors and administrators purpose.   Wikipedia solicits itself as a free public forum, and details it?ÇÖs own written polices, yet some editors and administrators have shown that they have seized control of wikipedia, deliberately using it solely for their own personal agenda and causes, while wrongly blocking the public (other contributing writers) from using it, and continue to falsely solicit that it?ÇÖs a free public forum.   Thus if you yet again plan to delete this talk and discussion, continue to uphold double standards and generate more false claims with which to wrongly block and threaten against us contributing writers of whom follow wikipedia?ÇÖs written community policies, then first notify wikipedia?ÇÖs owners and lawyers of your actions.   For this is still a free public community cooperative forum for everyone, that is until wikipedia formally changes it?ÇÖs published written polices and solicitations.   It can?ÇÖt have it both ways.   We await  your respected reply."

I know of no American papers that subscribe solely to the NYTimes and/or Washington Post News services without also subscribing to AP. AP is cheaper and far broader as far as breaking news goes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== History of AP, Brass Check ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo a Minister of Truth: I suggest Brass Check is a good book for the state of the AP at the turn of the century - there's more to it than Teletypes, after all. And if AP again has a monopoly on wire-servicing (in the animal-husbandry sense) the US public [just how is the UPI comment to be interpreted?], how that has played out in the past ought to be of interest. Especially since the AP is the sole collator of ``election`` ``results`` tomorrow. And if you protest Brass Check is not about the AP, I'll point out the older Library of Congress catalogue entries list ``Associated Press`` as one of its categories.  00:52, 2004 Nov 2 (UTC) (PS: count y'self lucky I merely mentioned the book, and didn't start rewriting the article.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: There are many, many books about the history of U.S. journalism that contain information about AP which might be of interest to this article, but ``Brass Check`` isn't one of them. It is wildly out of date (especially if you think it has relevance to the current situation; when it was written, AP was a struggling underdog). But of course you are welcome to start rewriting the article - that's the way Wikipedia works! -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: So put some of THOSE books in, fer cryin out loud. (wait. what? How can what is for years an indebted monopoly spreading completely inverted or entirely fabricated news with impunity qualify as ``struggling underdog``?) Incidentally, check history (unless WP has discarded it for lack of space)  I am not welcome, even when what I write is well-supported. As a for instance: Nurse Nayirah. (I do not contest that this is because of a certain immoderateness in my writing: after the outrage I've watched go on just the past four years - thanks in part to a US press that, in what counts, lies and covers up as baldly as Sinclair described 85 years ago - I cannot be moderate. If there were moderates taking my place I'd be happy; but so many waste themselves on absolute bread-and-circus garbage like American Idle.) I limit login now to when I express something that's only my opinion.  23:13, 2004 Nov 2 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Oh, I forgot to mention: someone thinks Brass Check interesting enough that the U of Illinois Press reprinted it about two years ago (ISBN 0252071107)  02:51, 2004 Nov 3 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAP's television service is now known as APTNNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNote: The picture on the main entry page shows the AP's old headquarters in Rockefeller Center.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Retracted Stories ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf we're going to list every retracted story that AP, or any other wire service, has run over the years, we're going to have to double the size of wikipedia! So I removed the long, rambling account of one such case, since it lacked context. Discussion about the merits, or lack thereof, of the wire service are certainly valuable additions to the article, but not in the form of a rant. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Explanation of AP fees ==NEWLINE_TOKENThis was originally posted on the Reference Desk with the title ``Is news public domain?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt seems from the public domain article that facts are in the public domain, but reporting of them may not be.  A news agency might do a lot of work to collect some news and expect just compensation.  So how is it that news stories can be ``picked up`` by competing agencies, e.g., the Associated Press picking up a story in a local newspaper?  Isn't that local news story under copyright?  Is there a fee involved or some sort of professional agreement?  Thanks.  15:10, 2004 Nov 16 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKEN:As you can see from the article on the AP, it's owned by its contributing newspapers.  A local newspaper allows its stories to be used by the AP because it has the opportunity to use AP wire stories itself.  So, the answer is that the news story is certainly under copyright, and the only fees/professional arrangements involved are the money and agreements necessary to maintain the AP. -) [[User:Jwrosenzweig|Jwrosen"

Nice job, kiddo. ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou said, one some poor guy's talk page:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI hope you will use this block time to consider a few matters that could make you a better editor, should you decide to continue. First, Wikipedia editors aren't nearly as stupid as you think they are. We include many people with advanced degrees who work in scholarly professions. Many of us can see through the kind of lies that you tried to use better than we can see through glass. Secondly, disruptive editing, lying, and attempts to sabotage the system not only get you into trouble, they also defeat the very goals that you are trying to achieve. If MattyBraps is deleted, one of the major reasons (but certainly not the only reason) is your behavior as creator of the article. You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor. Otherwise, you need to move on to somewhere else to spend your time. Think about it.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would contend that Wikipedia editors are, in fact, as stupid as I suspect, as you still fail to grasp that the BT guy and I (the IP user you believe he sockpuppeted) are not the same person. All it took was me mirroring the way he types, pretending to be angry, and claiming ``I made the [Mattybraps] page,`` and boom, I got him blocked. Thanks for helping me settle a bet about whether or not I could get the creator of the Mattyb wikipedia page (it's an embarrassment that it exists) banned inside of a week. I too have an advanced degree  turns out nobody gives a shit, champ. Keep up the excellent work.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`"

Then maybe he hires his maid to kill his wife just cuz he doesn't like his wife any more, that's a contract killing but not an assassination because his wife isn't a figurehead and he doesn't accomplish broad change.

The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms ``vandlism`` are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on. I don't know why, but I don't have to, and I expect the motivations aren't interesting. Respond if you have anything to say.   `"

Chances are they are also a cult group, or even a ghost religion (one that exists only in the Internet).

If you remove all the Bereans references in the Ang Dating Daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags, we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a month's time. It is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias. Quotes should be either from notable newspapers, magazines and books (self-published books not included). As I will never use articles from Soriano's website(s) to criticize, say for example, the Baptist sect, I would also not use articles from a Baptist website to criticize Soriano's sect.

It doesn't need to be this complicated. This is a fascinating lawsuit with real life disputes over ``Yamashita's treasure`` right smack in the middle of it. What is the real problem here? A Hawaiian court sided with Roxas in 1998. The Hawaii Supreme Court later sided with Marcos that insufficient evidence was presented to value restitution for the treasure seized. It remanded to the trial court that it rework its valuation for the assets seized in its judgment. The trial court returned a new judgment (published 2001 I believe), and this judgment was upheld by the Hawaii Supreme Court. So let's try this again fresh: don't simply repeat what's already been said (that's the reason why the dispute is still stuck-repeating the same thing again and again won't help). I ask you to keep it simple and to the point, 1 little tidy paragraph, that's it: what does this article need to say about Roxas v Marcos? and what does it need not to say? Can we do that?   `"

1	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: I am completely convinced now! You are most certainly a paid propagandist who's sole goal on wikipedia is the integral protection of Yugoslavs and Yugoslav historiography. Hilariously enough, one needs to spend years studying the complexity of NDH in order to get the correct picture - what you do not have and will never have because of your balkan irrationality and politically fueled interest in such a topic and the surrounding topics. I really do wish I had the time and energy to flip this all around, site sources - and become more familiar with wikipedia itself - but I do not. I have trumped you in almost every single section of argument - point for point. But you still continue and you have even removed things that I have written on discussion pages within long periods of time where I am not visibly present. I would probably do the same if someone like myself was embarrassing me intellectually in the way that I embarrass you. Stipe Mesic used NDH rhetoric several times in several countries to benefit his and the HDZ's political platform. If you are going to sit here and say that the memory of NDH had nothing to do with the creation of the modern Croatian state - well then you're lying to yourself and everyone else. The entire political emigration was founded upon the tradition of NDH. The modern wave of Croatian nationalism was the idea of national reconciliation between sons of Ustase and Partizani. That's in HDZ's original political platform. Tudman had to appeal to all Croatians - that's why you Tito lovers got to parade around with the false idea of antifascism at a time when the Croatian lobby couldn't combat 60 years of communist propaganda and the Serb wartime propaganda machine that was screaming - Tudman = Pavelic, look at the flag, look at the currency! I personally witnessed Stipe Mesic playing the NDH card. He is an opportunist. He was even caught singing ``Jure i Boban``. Coincidence ?  Of course not. It was to his political benefit. He also left Tudman's side to shake hands with Croatia's political right in their smear campaign against Tudman himself. That's right, Stipe Mesic at HSP rallies years before Anto Djapic and the HSP denounced the Ustasa Movement or Dr. Pavelic. Look at Djapic now... There's another great example. 15 years ago he was Ustasa number one. In recent years, European pressure has made it unfavorable - so now he sings a different tune. That's the best part. All these people are the biggest balkan chameleons who use these catch themes to fool all the little balkanites into ignoring real problems in the country. That is how NDH is relevant. However, your side has done so well in the creation of this so-called antifascism, that 'pro-NDHers' if you will can only 'fight back' by pointing out communist crimes. Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg isn't really Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg, its Ustasa historiography Vs Partizan historiography. Most people in Croatia sympathize with one side or the other - you know that, and I know that. You can sit here and throw out fallacies, fact is fact, Stipe Mesic at one point in time glorified the tenth of April and sang Ustasa songs. That is a fact. Dr. Pavelic was allied with the Axis, that is a fact. He later in his emigre days distanced himself and his movement from the Nazis and formed a Croatian Democratic movement (HOP). They're politicians !   `"

As far as the WP:RM (if this is what you had in mind) is concerned, my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure (I'm still not sure that there is one). Moreover, I'm certain that for the time being he doesn't think of another POV of the ``procedure``, because of this words of his, which are somehow unclear (at least to me): ``Any new proposals will be speedy closed. Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WP:ARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of.`` concerning the closure of ``proposal``. I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (``IroK``) or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ). Sorry for that.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the ``IroK`` more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term ``recognition`` (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::All the best.  `"

Even if it did, I don't follow the logic that it would make this chart ``superfluous``, since this chart gives an overview of the top-performers in the current market; if anything the current chart carries more relevance since it is probably of greater interest for film-makers to see how their films compare to the current competition, rather than films that were doing the rounds before they were even born.

I don't know where to begin describing everything that is wrong with him. I can see it in the replies to you as well. L.Ron's military career, if it is fabricated, is obviously worth discussing. I don't know why it would be fabricated, it wouldn't change my opinion of him or anythiing, so many times things aren't what they seem, but it's still worth looking into. It isn't 'he said, she said', it can be figured out what the truth is. And he says anything else is PR. This is what bugs me about justanother, he says things like they are fact. NO, it isn't just PR. It could be that he lied, it could be that there was a mistake, etc. That isn't PR.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOk, now I'm reading the posts on yourpage. This is so hard to understand. You're not supposed to talk about Scientology with him, he says? ``Is that clear``? See,he speaks to people with an air of superiority, like he is the voice of reason, of authority.``And I have no doubt that you consider yourself the soul of equanimity and justice.`` COMPLETE PROJECTION. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhoa, I'm on the Barbara Schwarz page, he did this with me to. I don't understand those people who feel the need to inform you of obvious thigns you would never do like you need them to inform you otherwise you would do it. He did that to me at first when we were friendly regarding editing Scientology pages (telling me not to do this or that, which I would never have done). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think the good thing is that this is just the internet. If it were real life, we would be able to tell in a second what was up with this guy and we wouldn't apply him the same weight that we apply other people. I sometimes forget that when I use the net because you're not getting the feel of the person saying the weird thing. It used to bug me some of the things that critics of Scientology used to say, and then I saw photos and video of them, and it made sense. You could tell they weren't really there, so I wasn't upset anymore. I'd love to see what this guy looks like. I'd probably end up feeling sorry for him and have compassion and overlook all the incredibly rude traits he has. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't know how to explain how things got bad between us. It's just his personality, who he is, and I disagree iwth it, find it incredibly rude and invalidating to other people, and just let him know. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN You're on the Scientology's 'enemies' list? What happened? You defintely didn't imply anythiing negative about Scientology, it's all good. People I know make jokes about Scientology and it's totally fine. I know what I don't like and don't agree it and I'm not sensing any of that from you. Another thing about Anynobdoy, is he DOES seem like everything is pro-Scientology, no matter what, and I've noticed that with some Scientologists, but that's not me, and that's wrong. I dislike a lot of Scientologists I've met because I can tell the kind of people they are and the kinds of things that they would do or think, and I'm just not okay with that. Scientology isn't some group that you join and become this ideal Scientologist and just turn into that. It's like when I go to the gym. I don't adapt the feeling and personality of the gym and the people in the gym. I go there to work my body, to use it as a tool. I do the same thing with Scientology. I really hate when people do that because what starts happening is they start feeling like they're better than others because they ``act`` more like an ideal Scientologist than people who aren't doing that, and all sorts of other things, which I think our friend here might've done.  )NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat was long and rambling, but I've been up all night with little sleep !

Some DH-SETs soud amazingly good even at ? 1% THD. Some transistor amps that measure at <0.002% sound crap. Unless and until you can explain this, and present some other measurement that actuyally do give a correlated indication of sonic ``acceptability`` - many high end audiophiles would suggest that you pay only passing attention to measurements. Your ears are much more sensitive. And to a music lover, more importantNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:FYI, I have also heard (indeed owned) extremely highly regarded (not to mention expensive) transistor amps, including from KRELL (KMA-100 class A monioblocks for the record). Most people would accept KRELL as being a reasonably good representative of breed  - and equally I have heard them blown into last week by tube amps.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Well, ideally of course we want no distortion, we want perfection. Which kinds of rules out class B immediately. Sadly that takes will it a large chunk of mainstream consumer electronics. If someone WANTs some odd  order or aharmonic distortion, thats a matter for them, but in that case I think we have nothing more to discuss with them about high end audio - they need help, and possible a hearing aidNEWLINE_TOKEN:Whoever claimed they were superior ? I have throughout gone out of my way to cite the disadvantages as well as the advantages of both, and also to note that the majority of tube amps use NFB as well as (almost all) transistor ones.#NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN::Didnt say you hadnt. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Actually you have. repeatedly. ;-)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:However such a statement as you make above is simply prejudice (not least as you admit you havent heard a decent tube amp in ages). Newer does not automatically equate to better. There are very many people who would agree with that statement (many of them also having never taken the time to actually try the alternatives they so enthusiastically condem). There are however also many people who HAVE heard who will say that transistors amps are not inherently superior. Wise people will probably find good examples and merits in both. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I wasnt aware of making any prejudiced statement. Which one? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::so many to choose from ...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:But the fact remains that NFB is not perfect either (I strongly recommend you read Colloms article referenced on this page), and at the high end there is a significant tendency to have greater open loop linearity and less NFB, with a significant slice of products using no NFB at all. The later being an option that transistors dont really give except in a very very few niche examples (refer my comments about Nelson Pass, below)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Yes it rules out class B if you prefer class A type distortion to crossover dist. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::This is facile/misleading. The whole point is that class A gives dramatically less (asymptotic to zero in fact), and sonically ``not so bad``  distortion under small signal conditions, whereas class B gives exponentially increasing distortion of a very unpleasant kind under the same conditions. Anyone who would ``choose`` large amounts of unpleasant distortion over lesser amounts of less objectionable distortion imho should abandon any pretensions of listening to HiFi, which is after all about ``high fidelity``. NB this is not saying class B has no place or is ``inferior``. It is much more efficient and as such is the only viable approach for high power on a budget etc etc etc. But lets not delude anyone that from a distortion perspective it is on a par and ``its a matter of choice which kind of distortion you prefer``.

I'm the author of a treatise titled the Ultra-Space Field Theory. Every once in a while I google the USF theory to see if its found a home on any new websites. I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it. (My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to request Melchoir be given an opportunity to read the treatise.

And Matisyahu seems to acknowledge this when he says: ``All of my songs are influenced and inspired by the teachings that inspire me.

Music taps into a very deep place and speaks to us in a way that regular words can't.`` So, I think he would be more than pleased to answer what are his views on homosexuality and whether his songs can be interpreted by gay teenagers to mean that they should fight for their freedom to express their sexuality, especially when he says: ``Young man control in your hand / Slam your fist on the table / And make your demand / Take a stand / Fan a fire for the flame of the youth / Got the freedom to choose`` and things like that.  `"

What I'm sceptical about is that they ever had a significant share of the UK market- I've already given my reasons why I'm not willing to accept this blindly. Although I'm too young to have experienced the early-70s first hand, I've seen endless cassettes and cassette equipment from the 70s... I have never, *once* seen an 8-track cartridge nor an 8-track player in the flesh. I've seen no evidence that they were popular fixtures in cars here in that era.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: As I said, yes, I know they were sold here at one point, and I'm sure some people had them.

However, your comment *was*, and is held to that higher standard.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: ``It was however very popular in the United Kingdom during this period.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: Saying that they're not just ``popular`` (in itself quite a strong statement) but ``very popular`` implies that they had a significant percentage of the overall music market at one point.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: Even, *if*, as you say, 8-track sales in the UK matched cassettes' at one stage, when was this? I understand that cassettes took a number of years to really achieve mass popularity.

0	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Polish view==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am from Poland. My view is this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe evidence of direct anti-Romanian actions undertaken by the USSR in the 1920s is abundant. The convention of October 28, 1920, whereby the British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan recognized Romanian sovereignty in Bessarabia, was rejected as invalid by the USSR. Moscow even denied the validity of that part of the convention that stipulated that, upon Russian request, the Council of the League of Nations could be empowered to arbitrate the Russo-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia. In short, the Kremlin insisted that Romania was illegally occupying Bessarabia. And it was because of this intransigent attitude that the Soviet Union refused to make any concessions. Romania's attempts, in the early 1920s, to seek accommodation with the USSR on all issues except the Bessarabian fell on deaf ears as the Kremlin encouraged revolutionary activities by Bolshevik elements in Bessarabia. The establishment in October, 1924, of the Autonomous Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic as a focal point for eventual reincorporation of Bessarabia into the USSR indeed eliminated the possibility of peaceful resolution of Russo-Romanian differences.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe exact position of the USSR on these issues is unknown except for Moscow's unwillingness to make any concessions to Bucharest on Bessarabian issues. Recent tracts by Romanian historians have emphasized the support given by Romanian Communists to the ``democratic forces`` opposed to alteration of the status quo in Transylvania in 1938 and subsequent years. True as this may be, there has been no evidence presented in support of any fundamental change in Moscow's traditional anti-Romanian positions with respect to Bessarabia in 1938 and subsequent years.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhether the Kremlin envisaged this entire scenario in August, 1940, is uncertain. But that this possible scenario was within the realm of Russia's long-range plans for Romania and Eastern Europe cannot be doubted. The Romanians were aware of Russian intentions throughout the interwar period, and the Hungarians were also conscious of the potential advantages to be derived from Russia's anti-Romanian attitudes in an eventual resolution of the Transylvanian question. And it is undeniable that the Romanians and the Hungarians remain aware of Russia's interests in Transylvania forty years after the Vienna Diktat.`"

1	"`, 18 December 2005 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPathoschild, I could kiss you a thousand times. Thank you for for smoothing out the blocking issue, and, especially, for hearing me!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs to arbitration: well, it sounds nice in theory, but I worry the actual good it'd do and how I'd probably be the one to get smacked down. At the risk of sounding, er, slightly paranoid, my style apparently makes me a magnet for All Bad Things and there is not much I can do about it. It seems as if Dominick can do and say anything, repeatedly, and nothing happens, but I get admonished (or blocked!) for sarcasm and things I didn't even do. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile I was blocked (which incident is forgiven): in the ``external links`` section at the entry ``Rosary,`` he replaced this link with this one, calling the former a ``monograph site`` (by which he means, apparently, that there is one person who oversees thing  even though I have SIX people and he has been informed of this. If there's anything in the rules about monographs, I'd like to see what the heck Dominick is talking about). Malachias111 (my ``meatpuppet``) had my back, but man, oh, man!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI just want for him to leave me ALONE, to quit libelling me and my life's work, and to stop taking down perfectly relevant, helpful, and informative links just because he hates traditional Catholicism. Dominick is a ``POV Warrior`` with a a neo-conservative Catholic POV who engages in harrassment and a soft form of ``vandalism`` (though I don't think his purpose is to imperil the integrity of the encyclopedia, he is removing perfectly good content for no good reason  and lying about that content in the process). If he wants to go through and put the line ``a traditional Catholic website`` after any link to my site, then fine. But removing the links, replacing them (esp. with lesser quality links), lying about them (he says they're a ``blog,`` ``POV,`` ``monograph,`` 'linkspam,`` etc.), slandering me and the site in his edit summary notes, etc.  I can't just let him do that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you can give me decent odds that I will get a fair ``hearing,`` if the abritrators will read my RfC and the associated discussion page, click on the links, and look into what I have been saying, then I would very much like to move forward; but, if the odds say it's going to be a matter of their looking at style over substance (e.g., seeing my admitted sarcasm after months of weirdness and not looking into the reasons for it), then , I dunno 'cause I can't take another ``Oh, great, he wins again!`` type situation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI will try to be more civil as it is apparently defined, but if it weren't for sarcasm, I don't know how I'd survive this stuff. If you knew what I'd been tempted to say, you'd think I were Mother Theresa LOL NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn any case, I thank you for your attention. It's good to know I am not being totally ignored in all this and that someone out there is actually hearing me. No, it's beyond ``good``; it is a RELIEF as this has been really upsetting and time-consuming for me. I appreciate your time and know it can't be any fun for you either; I make my own self sick repeating my defense over and over LOL. Wish I didn't have to. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI saw earlier, though, that there are things going on in your ``real life`` that were, at least, to take you away from administrating until after Christmas. I hope that, whatever those events may be, they are happy ones. Assuming the odds are decent and this goes forward at all, if bringing all this up to an arbitration committee is too time-consuming or distracting, it can wait 'til after Christmas when you have more time. Sounds as though you have stuff going on...  20:07`"

It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.NEWLINE_TOKENAt Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is ``unyielding`` and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the hall, Snape orders anyone who may hold information regarding Harry's location to tell him immediately or face punishment. Harry then reveals himself after hiding within the crowd and rebukes Snape for standing where Dumbledore once stood as Headmaster, ordering him to tell the students the truth of how he betrayed and killed Dumbledore as Order Of The Phoenix members enter the Great Hall.

1	"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear friend Tajik. You must be mistaken or led by your emotions. Turks were called as Turks before Islam. East Roman Empire sent Zemarkhos as an ambassador in the middle of 6th century to Istemi Kagan of Western Turks. And in the year 567 Istemi Kagan sent a group of emissaries led by a Soghdian named Maniakh to Eastern Rome. Both attempts were to form an allience against Sasanid kingdom, the common foe. In the chronicles of Zemarkhos Turks were explicitly called as Turks. Those times were at least 100 years before Islam. Also Turks called themselves as Turks. You can go and read the genuine Tukish monuments in Mongolia. The monuments belong to the first quarter of 8th century. At those times Turks were fighting against Muslim Arabs. Also when you check the Chinese dynasties' chronicles Pei-shih (386-618), Chou-shu (557-589), Sui-shu (589-618) you can find quite alot of information on Turks. And also some Chinese Turkologists claim that the earliest ancestors of Turks were Tiks (9.-8. century B.C.)Chinese documents have more than claims. Dr. T'ang Chi's works are worth examining. Also you can check a French man L. Bazin's works. Coming to your claims that Turks are a minority in Anatolia. I suggest you to read the chronicles of Armenians during te medieval times. For example Matthew of Edessa (Matevos Urhayetsi-in Armenian). You can by your self judge that Turks have never been a minority in Anatolia. By the way, have you ever been to Turkey?

0	"`The-Pope]]====NEWLINE_TOKENBy stating ``Comments about the opinions and supposed motivations of other editor will be removed`` you are completely missing the point. We have some people in the Australian community (both on and of wiki) who only call the round ball game football (or maybe association football) and get offended/upset/angry by the word soccer due to previous negative connotations of the word. Others use the word football exclusively for another code, most commonly Australian rules football, and only use soccer (without any intended offence) for the round ball game. Then you have another group who are happy to use either term, depending on context or to avoid any possible ambiguity. What proportion of the population is in each group depends on location, age, era, ethnicity/cultural background, etc. So there is no single consensus.  I'm for soccer if it avoids confusion of codes (such as a in a multi-sport stadium article or a suburb article), but using football is ok if a dedicated article (such as a team or player article), all with a piped link to association football (a term which is rarely used and can also be ambiguous in parts Australia with Australian rules football games played in competitions named Associations such as the Victorian Football Association). Extrapolating the no move decision in that RM about a single parent article to apply to every mention of the sport is invalid, in my opinion. Achieving a true consensus is near impossible because we aren't a homogenous society.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN====[[User:`"

(Also, the use of perjorative terms such as ridiculous or farcical do not strengthen your case, perhaps you could rephrase?) Personally, I'm inclined to trust your judgment but this doesn't mean that scrutiny isn't merited. So I did check the Kelman article you cite above, in which he states: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat would be the meaning of an Israeli acknowledgment-or, for that matter, an acknowledgment by the United States or other third parties-of Palestinian nationhood? Most important, nationhood implies certain attributes and rights; thus, to acknowledge that Palestinians are a nation would carry with it certain implications for issues that are currently matters of contention between the parties.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Kelman here indicates that (recently) various major parties did not acknowledge the Palestinians as a nation and that it is/was a contested matter. Later, he says: ``Acknowledgment of Palestinian nationhood, with all of the implications that I have outlined, could hardly be described as a trivial exercise. While Israelis-in government, the media, and the general public-now freely use the term ``Palestinian,`` they do not necessarily conceive of the Palestinians as a nation with the attributes and rights that such a designation implies.`` Kelman thereby seems to contradict your view that the scrutiny of the 'nation' designation (i.e., your edit) is farcical because he says it is ``not a trivial exercise`` and that Israelis ``do not necessarily conceive of the Palestinians as a nation...`` Also, I would caution that, while Kelman advocates acknowledging nationhood, his article rarely uses the word ``nation`` and he deploys 'nationhood' in relation to political rights (tho' not nec. sovereignty), not as synonymous to people. In short, while I gladly concede that 'nation' might be accepted by all editors based solely on your reasoning, I don't think you should be surprised or uncharitable if some editors ask for various degrees of verification. Also, it's unfortunate that you happened to bring a source that seems to undermine or even contradict your claim. (You clearly did so in good faith, but it may raise doubts about the other sources.)

I'd recommend sub-articles only if there is sufficient to write moderately sized articles about those individual ITPAs. Otherwise, a single article covering all of them will be a better idea.

The Vedic Rajas & old Kshatriyas(tribals),not satisfied with their married wives,had frequently children by their female slaves,who although not legitimate successors to the throne,these illegitimate children were styled Rajpoots,or the children of Rajas``The word ``Rajput`` is used in certain parts of Rajasthan to denote the illegitimate sons of a Kshatriya chief or Zamidar.`` [Mahajan: 1972: 550 ff.] The conclusion is obvious that they were not considered by the original residentsto be respectable, to start with. This is because ``Raaja`` means royal but ``Raj`` means semen. The progeny of mixed marriages is even now called by that name in some parts. The condition of woman was deteriorating. The question of women education was unthinkable. Obscene Art flourished during Rajput age. The originality of the ancient times was lost and the ancient culture degenerated. The country fell into the hands of Rajput barons, soon to be followed by the Mohammedan invaders who completed the work of annihilation.

0	"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe rise and development of the Haskalah, or Jewish enlightenment, was different in Western Europe and Eastern Europe. In the West, an attempt was made to strip Judaism of its national character, and label it merely a ``religion.`` The motivation behind this was to defend recently acquired political rights; and in particular, the new idea that Jews were citizens of the European ``states`` in which they resided. In retrospect the giving of political rights to Western European Jewish residents was contingent on their ceasing to be Jews in the traditional sense; or in any sense at all. The ?Ç£reform?Ç¥ movement, started in Germany, was an attempt to give religious imprimatur to these developments; including rejecting the re-establishment of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem; and thus naming synagogues ?Ç£temples.?Ç¥ In the East, the Haskalah led to secular Jewish nationalism (e.g., Chaim Zhitlowsky's ideas); of which Zionism was just the most successful and consequential. However, even in the East, there were assimilationists who wanted to dissociate themselves from their heritage to gain approval of gentiles. The ?Ç£Jew?Ç¥ that is the subject of antisemitism is an artificial construct of the Roman Catholic church; and has no connection to flesh and blood Jews. It was an attempt by Jews to distance themselves from the chimera of Christian theology that later morphed into racism, (invented to attack newly acquired Jewish political rights in Europe), that Jews were attempting, perhaps understandably, to distance themselves from. Even in America, there were references to ?Ç£Hebrews?Ç¥ instead of ?Ç£Jews?Ç¥; in an effort to seek approbation from gentiles; and distance Jews from Christian mythology. (It should be noted that America?ÇÖs, (i.e., the United States, but not Canada?ÇÖs), offer of citizenship was genuine and not a quid pro quo.) So your reference to 20th century Hungary was out of context, unexplained, un-encyclopedic; and therefore, inappropriate. That is why I deleted it.  `"
